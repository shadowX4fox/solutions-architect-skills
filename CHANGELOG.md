## [3.14.0]

### Added — Universal `architecture-explorer` Haiku-tier doc classifier (infrastructure)

Front-door classifier for every doc-consuming workflow in the plugin. Treats ARCHITECTURE.md, `docs/`, `adr/`, and `docs/components/**` as a universe and answers one question per file: *is this relevant to the current task?* Reads only the first 60 lines + headings of each candidate (sampling, not synthesis), so classification stays cheap on Haiku while keeping the user's main session (typically Opus) and downstream synthesis agents (Sonnet/Opus validators, generators, reviewers) off the redundant-read treadmill.

**Why this matters**: a 10-contract compliance run today does ~1.8 MB of redundant Opus reads (10 validators + 10 generators each open the full doc suite). A 10-analysis run does ~1.5–2 MB. The explorer outputs an `EXPLORE_RESULT` allowlist (`relevant_files[]`, typically 4–9 files instead of 20+) that downstream agents will honor in v3.14.x patches — token budget on the synthesis tier drops by ≥30% per skill once integrations land.

**Always-on by design**: there is no `--no-explorer` opt-out. The false-negative safeguard is at the config level — every `agents/configs/explorer/<task_type>.json` declares `required_sections[]` that bypass scoring. The runtime parser (`skills/architecture-explorer/utils/parse-explore-result.ts`) rejects any `EXPLORE_RESULT` whose `relevant_files[]` is missing a `required_sections[]` entry, falling back to degraded mode (use the required list directly, skip the explorer call) so a malformed agent response never strips load-bearing files.

#### New files

- **Agent** — `agents/builders/architecture-explorer.md` (model: haiku). Universal Haiku-tier classifier; reads `agents/configs/explorer/<task_type>.json`, expands `candidate_files[]`, scores against `relevance_keywords.boost[]` + anchor hints, detects gaps via `gap_markers[]`, returns `EXPLORE_RESULT` block. Cache-keyed by candidate-file mtimes + plugin version + config mtime.
- **Configs** — `agents/configs/explorer/` (36 task-typed JSON configs):
  - 10 compliance: `compliance-{sre,security,cloud,business-continuity,cloud,data-and-ai,development,enterprise,integration,platform,process}.json`. SRE / security / cloud are hand-tuned; the other 7 are auto-derived from existing `agents/configs/<contract>.json` `phase3.required_files` + `data_points`.
  - 10 analysis: `analysis-{spof,blast-radius,bottleneck,cost-hotspots,stride,vendor-lockin,latency-budget,tech-debt,coupling,data-sensitivity}.json`.
  - 13 peer-review: `peer-review-{struct,naming,sections,coherence,tech,integ,metrics,scale,security,perf,ops,adr,tradeoff}.json` (one per category in `skills/architecture-peer-review/PEER_REVIEW_CRITERIA.md`).
  - 3 special: `handoff-component.json` (per-component classification feeding handoff-slicer when v3.14.x splits the builder), `architecture-question.json` (free-form Q&A; relevance keywords injected at runtime from question terms), `adr-application.json` (ADR creation/supersession context).
  - `_schema.json` — JSON Schema validating every config.
- **TypeScript utilities** — `skills/architecture-explorer/utils/`:
  - `explore-cache.ts` — `/tmp/architecture-explorer/<project_hash>/<task_type>.json` cache read/write + `inputs_hash` computation (mtimes + plugin version + config mtime) + zero-dependency glob expansion.
  - `parse-explore-result.ts` — extracts and validates the `EXPLORE_RESULT` YAML block emitted by the agent; enforces required-sections coverage; ships its own minimal YAML subset parser (no external deps).
  - `validate-config.ts` — runtime schema validation for `agents/configs/explorer/*.json`.
  - `explore-cli.ts` — Bun CLI invoked by the explorer agent (subcommands: `inputs-hash`, `check-cache`, `expand-candidates`, `write-cache`, `read-cache`, `project-hash`).
- **Auto-derivation script** — `tools/derive-explorer-configs.ts`. One-shot Bun script that projects from existing source-of-truth (`agents/configs/<contract>.json` `phase3.data_points` patterns; analysis vocabulary mappings; peer-review category checks) into 33 explorer configs. Skips existing configs by default; pass `--force` to overwrite.
- **Explorer-Friendly Headers** — new `## Explorer-Friendly Headers` section in `skills/architecture-docs/ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md` documents an `<!-- EXPLORER_HEADER ... -->` block (5–10 lines after the H1) that newly-created `docs/NN-*.md` and `docs/components/**/*.md` files must include. Lists key_concepts, technologies, components, scope, and related ADRs in the first 60 lines so the explorer's body sample lands on dense, classifier-relevant metadata. Backwards-compatible — legacy docs without the header still work, the explorer falls back to body+heading scoring. `ARCHITECTURE.md` (project root) is exempt; the explorer reads it in full as the navigation index.
- **`/setup` permissions update** — `.claude/settings.json.example` extended with three new entries: `Agent(sa-skills:architecture-explorer)`, `Write(//tmp/architecture-explorer/**)`, `Read(//tmp/architecture-explorer/**)`. Existing projects re-running `/setup` after upgrading get these appended non-destructively (the `setup-permissions.ts` helper does an array union and counts pre-existing entries under "already present"). Comment headers in the example file updated to mention the explorer + headers CLIs and the per-project cache. New `## v3.14.0 — what's new in this setup` section in `commands/setup.md` documents what re-running adds.
- **`architecture-explorer-headers` skill + slash command** — new `skills/architecture-explorer-headers/` skill with `/regenerate-explorer-headers` slash command for backfilling EXPLORER_HEADER blocks into legacy docs. Workflow: Phase 1 inventory (Bun CLI walks `docs/` + `docs/components/`, excludes `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `README.md`, returns JSON of `{path, has_header, h1, byte_size}`) → Phase 2 plan-and-confirm → Phase 3 model-generated header inserted via Edit tool right after the H1 → Phase 4 report. Supports `--dry-run` (no writes), `--force` (overwrite existing), and `<path-glob>` (restrict scope). TypeScript module `header-detector.ts` exports `listDocFiles`, `hasExplorerHeader`, `findInsertionPoint`, `parseHeader`, `validateHeader`, `insertHeader`, `removeHeader`, `buildHeader`. Bun CLI `header-cli.ts` (subcommands: `list`, `validate`, `has-header`). 30 unit tests covering detection, insertion (idempotent + force semantics), removal, parsing round-trip, validation (doc files require key_concepts+technologies+scope; component files additionally require component_self), and the fs walker (excludes ARCHITECTURE.md, recurses components/, does not recurse other docs/ subdirs).
- **Tests** — `skills/architecture-explorer/utils/explore-cache.test.ts` (cache round-trip, mtime invalidation, plugin-upgrade invalidation, project-hash collision-resistance, glob expansion), `parse-explore-result.test.ts` (happy path, malformed YAML, missing required fields, false-negative safeguard rejection), `validate-config.test.ts` (every shipped config passes the schema; targeted error cases). Total: 45 tests across 3 files.

#### Documentation

- `CLAUDE.md` — Plugin Structure section now lists `agents/configs/explorer/` and `architecture-explorer.md`; new "Architecture-explorer (v3.14.0)" paragraph in Code Architecture explaining the contract; TypeScript utilities section split into compliance + explorer subsections.
- This `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

#### Per-skill integration roadmap (v3.14.x patches)

| Patch | Skill | Work |
|-------|-------|------|
| 3.14.1 | `architecture-compliance` | Insert Step 3.2.5 Explore Phase before validator/generator fan-out; wire `compliance-generator.md` + 10 validators to honor `EXPLORE_RESULT.relevant_files[]` |
| 3.14.2 | `architecture-analysis` | Insert Step 2.5 Explore Phase; wire `architecture-analysis-agent.md` to honor `relevant_files[]` |
| 3.14.3 | `architecture-peer-review` | Insert Step 4.5 Explore Phase (all depths); wire `peer-review-category-agent.md` |
| 3.14.4 | `architecture-dev-handoff` | Refactor `handoff-context-builder.md` → `handoff-slicer.md` (Sonnet, slicing/dedup/manifest only) with `architecture-explorer` running first via `handoff-component.json` |
| 3.14.5 | `architecture-docs` | Q&A workflows route through explorer with runtime keyword injection (`architecture-question.json`) |
| 3.14.6 | `architecture-definition-record` | ADR create/supersede route through explorer (`adr-application.json`) |

Each patch ships independently — no patch depends on a later patch. `architecture-explorer` is self-contained infrastructure in v3.14.0; integrations are additive.

#### Verification

`bun run typecheck` ✅ · `bun test skills/architecture-explorer/` (45/45 pass) ✅ · 36/36 explorer configs validate against `_schema.json` ✅ · auto-derivation script runs cleanly (`bun run tools/derive-explorer-configs.ts`) ✅

## [3.13.1]

### Changed
- **Reorganized `agents/` by role**: `agents/generators/` (compliance-generator, docs-export-generator, handoff-generator), `agents/builders/` (handoff-context-builder), `agents/reviewers/` (architecture-analysis-agent, peer-review-category-agent), `agents/validators/` (10 domain validators, unchanged location), `agents/configs/` (10 domain JSON configs, was `agents/base/configs/`). The misleading `agents/base/` parent directory is gone.
- All 16 file moves use `git mv` so per-file history is preserved.

### Updated (coordinated path references — 33 files total)
- Runtime: `agents/generators/compliance-generator.md` and `agents/validators/*-validator.md` (×10) read configs from `[plugin_dir]/agents/configs/` instead of `[plugin_dir]/agents/base/configs/`. `tools/bundle-handoff-agent.ts` + its test target the new agent paths. `scripts/build-release.sh` error messages updated.
- Documentation: `CLAUDE.md` Plugin Structure section rewritten. SKILL.md path mentions in `architecture-dev-handoff`, `architecture-docs-export`, `architecture-peer-review` updated. `PAYLOAD_SCHEMA.md` `Consumers:` footer updated and re-bundled into `handoff-context-builder.md`.

### Not changed
- Agent invocation: Claude Code resolves agents by `name:` frontmatter (`sa-skills:<name>`), so subdirectory location does not affect spawn. No skill needs to change which agent it calls.
- Behavior: pure refactor. Zero functional changes vs v3.13.0.
- Historical CHANGELOG and README roadmap entries (v3.5.x → v3.13.0): intentionally left intact — they accurately document file paths at those release points.

### Verification
`bun run typecheck` ✅ · `bun run bundle:check` (both bundles in sync) ✅ · 353/353 tests pass ✅ · `bash scripts/build-release.sh` smoke-test ✅

## [3.13.0]

### Performance — `architecture-dev-handoff` token + wall-clock overhaul

Nine fixes ranked by measured impact from a captured 8-component run (~481K tokens / ~50 min wall-clock). Targets: ~70% token reduction on full runs, ~80% on minor-architecture-bump runs, ~40–50% wall-clock cut.

#### Added
- `agents/handoff-context-builder.md` — new sub-agent pinned to `model: sonnet`. Owns all I/O-heavy work previously done in the orchestrator's main context (which inherits the user's session model — typically Opus): reading `docs/01` + `docs/04–09` once, building the ADR term-index from each `adr/*.md` first 30 lines, per-component slicing, parsing component files into the `## Component (structured)` YAML payload format, dedup of shared excerpts to `_shared.md`, payload writing, and SHA-256 manifest fingerprint + skip-vs-regen decision per component. Returns a `CONTEXT_RESULT:` block to the orchestrator listing each component's `payload_path`, `payload_hash`, `decision`, `reason`, `asset_types`, and `handoff_file_rel`. Effect: the orchestrator's main context never loads the ~80–120 KB of shared docs + ADR corpus, and the file-shuffling work runs on Sonnet instead of Opus.
- `tools/bundle-handoff-agent.ts` — bundles static reference files into BOTH sub-agents now: `agents/handoff-generator.md` (HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md, SECTION_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md, assets/_index.md, ASSET_GENERATION_GUIDE.md) AND `agents/handoff-context-builder.md` (PAYLOAD_SCHEMA.md). Uses a `BUNDLE_TARGETS` array so future agents are easy to add. Bundled content lives in each sub-agent's system prompt and is API-prompt-cached across all spawns within the orchestration window — saving ~300K tokens per 8-component run on the handoff-generator side vs. fresh per-spawn Reads.
- `package.json` scripts: `bundle:handoff-agent` (rebuild bundle) and `bundle:check` (CI guard, exit 1 on drift).
- `tools/bundle-handoff-agent.test.ts` — sync test asserting the agent file is in sync with its sources.
- `scripts/build-release.sh` — runs `bundle:check` before zipping; release fails on drift.
- `skills/architecture-dev-handoff/utils/manifest.ts` + `manifest-cli.ts` — `handoffs/.manifest.json` with SHA-256 fingerprint of `payload + template_version`. The orchestrator skips components whose fingerprint matches the manifest entry AND whose handoff file still exists. Big win on minor-architecture-bump runs (5/8 components typically unchanged).
- `skills/architecture-dev-handoff/utils/manifest.test.ts` — 18 unit tests covering hash determinism, manifest round-trip, all skip/regen conditions, and the CLI smoke path.
- `--parallelism N` orchestrator flag (default 4, capped at 8) — Phase 5 batch size, raised from the v3.6.1 default of 2 (sub-agents are independent on read-only payloads, so 4-way fan-out cuts wall-clock by ~50%).
- `--force` orchestrator flag — bypass manifest skip-if-unchanged.
- `## Component (structured)` payload section — typed YAML block (`component.name`, `component.type`, `component.apis`, `component.config`, `component.scaling`, …) replaces the verbatim 100–200 line `## Component File` markdown blob. Denser and more deterministic for the sub-agent to consume. Raw fallback (`## Component File (raw)`) preserved for unfamiliar component-doc structures.
- `_shared.md` deduplication — content that appears verbatim in ≥3 component payloads (typically org-wide ADRs like ADR-012 mTLS, ADR-014 WAF) is written once to `/tmp/handoff-payloads/_shared.md` and referenced via `> See: _shared.md § Shared: <header>` markers. Sub-agent PHASE 0.3 resolves markers in memory before fill. ~30% smaller payloads on average for multi-component runs.
- ADR pre-grep index pass — first 30 lines of every `adr/*.md` are read once into an in-memory term index; per-component lookup intersects against the index, full-Reading only the ADRs each component actually needs. Cuts orchestrator-side ADR token cost by ~60%.
- `Phase 7` report now prints `Skipped (unchanged): K component(s)` and `Main-context reads (ADRs): matched/total`.

#### Changed
- `agents/handoff-generator.md`: PHASE 1 no longer issues Read calls for plugin reference files (now bundled). PHASE 2 codifies the **Single-Write rule** — fill the entire template in memory, emit one `Write` call (target: 4–6 tool calls per spawn instead of the 15–31 observed in v3.12.0). PHASE 0 Step 0.3 added for `_shared.md` resolution. Per-section guidance updated to read from `component.<key>` (structured YAML) instead of `## Component File` markdown.
- `agents/handoff-generator.md` frontmatter: dropped `Bash` from `tools:` — sub-agents no longer invoke any shell command (asset directory pre-created by orchestrator; `generation_date` from payload frontmatter; references bundled).
- `skills/architecture-dev-handoff/SKILL.md` Phase 5: batch language switched from "batches of 2" to "batches of `parallelism`".
- `skills/architecture-dev-handoff/SKILL.md` Phases 3 + 4: collapsed into a single `handoff-context-builder` sub-agent spawn (Phase 3.5) plus a small "pre-create asset directories for REGEN components" step (Phase 4). The orchestrator's pre-spawn work now consists of: parse flags → locate `ARCHITECTURE.md` → load the component index → detect `doc_language` → spawn context-builder → consume `CONTEXT_RESULT` → spawn handoff-generators for REGEN entries → write manifest → report. Steps 3.1 (full shared-doc Reads), 3.1b (ADR index pass), 4.1–4.5 (per-component parsing + payload writing + manifest checks) all moved into `handoff-context-builder`.
- `skills/architecture-dev-handoff/PAYLOAD_SCHEMA.md`: schema version bumped 1.0.0 → 2.0.0; documented `## Component (structured)` block, `shared_refs` frontmatter, `> See:` body marker.

#### Removed
- `skills/architecture-dev-handoff/SKILL.md` Step 0c (plugin-ref staging to `/tmp/handoff-plugin-refs/`) — obsoleted by the agent bundle. Permissions block dropped `/tmp/handoff-plugin-refs/*` grants.
- `skills/architecture-dev-handoff/SKILL.md` Step 2.2 (dependency-based component ordering) — sub-agents never read prior handoffs, so the sort provided no information benefit. Components now ordered by `component_index_position`.

#### Migration
- First run after upgrade has no `handoffs/.manifest.json` → all components REGEN → manifest created. No surprises.
- Payloads from earlier versions on disk are ephemeral (`/tmp/handoff-payloads/`); new payloads are written every run.
- Existing handoff files are not modified by the upgrade itself; they're re-evaluated against the new manifest at the next orchestration.

#### Permissions delta
- Added: `Read(handoffs/.manifest.json)`, `Write(handoffs/.manifest.json)`, `Agent(sa-skills:handoff-context-builder)`
- Removed: `Read(/tmp/handoff-plugin-refs/*)`, `Write(/tmp/handoff-plugin-refs/*)`

## [3.5.8]

### Changed
- All 13 sub-agents migrated to `model: opus` (from `model: sonnet`):
  - `agents/compliance-generator.md`, `agents/peer-review-category-agent.md`, `agents/architecture-analysis-agent.md`
  - 10 validators under `agents/validators/` (business-continuity, cloud, data-ai, development, enterprise, integration, platform, process, security, sre)
- Rationale: On the Anthropic API, the `opus` alias currently resolves to Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context). Stronger reasoning improves compliance contract fidelity, peer-review nuance, validator evidence extraction, and architecture-analysis classification; 1M window removes the split-read constraints previously planned for large ARCHITECTURE.md suites.
- Skills (14) require no changes — all use current tool patterns and parallel agent spawning idioms supported natively by Opus 4.7. Skill frontmatter continues to inherit model selection from the calling session.

## [2.10.21]

### Added
- `redis-key-schema.md` asset type for Redis/Cache/ElastiCache/Memcached/Valkey components in `architecture-dev-handoff` skill
- New Asset 7 section in `ASSET_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` covering instance configuration, connection pooling, key patterns table, TTL strategy, eviction policy, memory sizing, and fail-open behavior

### Changed
- `SKILL.md` Step 3.2 type detection table: Redis removed from `ddl.sql` row; new row maps Redis/Cache/ElastiCache/Memcached/Valkey → `redis-key-schema.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`: Added `redis-key-schema.md (Redis/Cache)` to asset type lists

## [2.10.20]

### Changed
- `skills/architecture-peer-review/PLAYGROUND_TEMPLATE.md`: Fix prompt header now reads `"Use /skill architecture-docs to update the ARCHITECTURE.md..."` — ensures remediation always routes through the architecture-docs skill
- `.claude/settings.json` + `.claude/settings.json.example`: Added `"Bash(ls *)"` permission to prevent approval prompts when skills run `ls` on the plugin marketplace directory
- `CLAUDE.md`: Permissions block updated to include `"Bash(ls *)"`

## [2.10.19]

### Changed
- `skills/architecture-blueprint/APPLICATION_TEMPLATE_ES.md`: 6 hardcoded threshold lines replaced with `<placeholder>` fields for LLM analysis

- `skills/architecture-blueprint/BUSINESS_TEMPLATE.md`: Business template ("Datos de la Iniciativa") with 20 placeholders

## [2.10.15]

### Added
- `skills/architecture-docs-export/SKILL.md`: `docs/02-architecture-principles.md` added as required source; `## Architecture Principles` section added to Step A.2 composed document structure
- `.claude/settings.json` + `.claude/settings.json.example`: Added `Read(~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/shadowx4fox-solution-architect-marketplace/*)` permission

## [2.10.14]

### Changed

- `skills/architecture-dev-handoff/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`: All gap tokens standardized to canonical `NOT DOCUMENTED`; removed example hints from placeholders
- `skills/architecture-dev-handoff/SECTION_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md`: Eliminated permissive "infer" instructions; global-to-component substitution requires `[GLOBAL — not component-specific]` annotation; acceptance criteria synthesis requires source citation

## [2.10.11]

### Added
- `skills/architecture-dev-handoff/SKILL.md`: Asset-Documentation Fidelity Policy with 5 rules (EXACT MATCH, NO DEFAULTS, NO EXTRA FIELDS, NO OMISSIONS, COMPLETENESS CHECK)

- `skills/architecture-component-guardian/`: Renamed from `component-index-guardian` for consistent `architecture-*` prefix

### Removed
- `skills/architecture-docs/SKILL.md`: Presentation Generation workflow (~500 lines) and `officegen` dependency removed; Workflow 9 → 8, Workflow 10 → 9

## [2.8.28]

### Fixed
- Skill routing: "recreate/regenerate/rebuild compliance manifest" no longer triggers `architecture-compliance-review`

## [2.8.27]

### Fixed
- Compliance manifest date accuracy: contract's embedded generation date used instead of UTC re-computation; all date fields use local timezone via `getLocalDateString()`

## [2.8.26]

### Changed
- `architecture-compliance-review/SKILL.md`: Removed fix prompt generation; playground is now a pure exploration tool

## [2.8.25]

### Added
- `skills/architecture-compliance-review/SKILL.md` (new skill): Validates all 10 compliance contracts are present and ≤6 months old; gap extraction; concept clustering; interactive HTML playground — portfolio health panel + concept cluster gap explorer

## [2.8.24]

### Fixed
- Plugin directory resolution in compliance skill: replaced temp-file approach with direct `bun ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/.../resolve-plugin-dir.ts` call

## [2.8.23]

### Fixed
- `Write(//tmp/*)` permission path: changed `file_path` to use `//tmp/` double-slash prefix to match permission pattern exactly

## [2.8.22]

### Fixed
- Write tool path for plugin dir discovery: annotated `file_path` with explicit warning to use absolute `/tmp/` path

## [2.8.21]

### Fixed
- Temp file creation in Step B: explicitly uses Write tool; forbids `cat`/Bash/heredoc to eliminate security prompt

## [2.8.20]

### Fixed
- Plugin dir discovery in compliance skill: replaced hardcoded path with temp-file discovery script that scans `$HOME` for `resolve-plugin-dir.ts`

## [2.8.19]

### Added
- `skills/architecture-compliance/utils/resolve-plugin-dir.ts`: uses `import.meta.dir` to compute plugin root from its own location

### Fixed
- `SKILL.md` Step 3.1: added Step B fallback using `resolve-plugin-dir.ts` when Glob fails

## [2.8.18]

### Fixed
- All 10 compliance agents: removed leading `/` from output paths — agents now write to `compliance-docs/FILENAME.md` (relative, matches `Write(compliance-docs/*)` permission)

## [2.8.17]

## [2.8.4]

### Fixed
- `Bash(bun *)` permission: changed to wildcard that matches full absolute paths

## [2.8.3]

## [2.8.1]

### Changed
- All 10 compliance agents switched to `model: haiku` (reverted in v2.8.2)
