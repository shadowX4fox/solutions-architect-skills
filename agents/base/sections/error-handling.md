## Error Handling

- If ARCHITECTURE.md not found → Return error message with guidance
- If template expansion fails → Return bash error output
- If required section missing → Mark fields as "Unknown", continue generation
- Always return a result (success or failure) - never exit silently

## Performance Optimization

- Pre-configured section mappings (no runtime lookup)
- Domain-specific Grep patterns for fast extraction
- Minimal context loading (only required sections)
- Parallel-safe execution (unique output filename)
