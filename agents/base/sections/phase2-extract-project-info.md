### PHASE 2: Extract Project Information

**Step 2.1: Read Navigation Index**

Use Read tool to read the full ARCHITECTURE.md (now a navigation index, ~130 lines):
```
Read file: [architecture_file]
Extract project name from first H1 (line starting with "# ")
Note: ARCHITECTURE.md is a navigation index only — section content lives in docs/ files
```

**Step 2.2: Get Current Date**

Use Bash tool:
```bash
date +%Y-%m-%d
```
Store as: generation_date
