# Section 4: Meta Architecture - 3-Tier Classic Web Application

<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE: 3-TIER -->

**Purpose**: Define the three-tier architecture model that separates presentation, business logic, and data concerns.

This template follows the **3-Tier Architecture** pattern, designed for standard web applications, REST APIs, and line-of-business systems.

---

## Tiers Overview

| Tier | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Presentation** | User interface layer handling all user interactions, including web pages, API endpoints, and client-side logic. |
| **Application/Business Logic** | Core business logic, application services, orchestration, and business rules implementation. |
| **Data** | Data persistence, database management, data access layer, and data integrity enforcement. |

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Data persistence and retrieval

- Query optimization
- Backup and recovery
- Database schema management

**Communication Patterns**:
- Inbound: [Database queries from Application tier]
- Outbound: [None - terminal tier, or replication to other databases]

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- Performance: [Query response time, transactions per second]
- Availability: [Database clustering, failover]
- Scalability: [Read replicas, sharding strategy]

## Data Flow

**Typical Request Flow (Top-Down)**:

```
1. User interacts with Web UI or makes API call
   ↓
2. Presentation Tier receives request
   - Validates input
   - Authenticates user
   - Routes to appropriate controller/handler
   ↓
3. Application Tier processes request
   - Executes business logic
   - Applies business rules
   - Coordinates multiple operations if needed
   ↓
4. Data Tier persists or retrieves data
   - Executes database queries
   - Manages transactions
   - Returns data
   ↓
5. Application Tier transforms data
   - Maps domain models to DTOs
   - Applies additional business rules
   ↓
6. Presentation Tier formats response
   - Converts to JSON/HTML
   - Sends response to client
```

**Typical Response Flow (Bottom-Up)**:

```
Data → Application → Presentation → User
```

## Example Implementation

### Tier 1: Presentation Layer

**Purpose**: Provide a responsive web interface and RESTful API for customer account management.

**Components**:
- Web UI: React-based single-page application (SPA)
- API Controllers: Express.js REST endpoints
- Client-Side Logic: Redux state management, form validation

**Technologies**:
- Primary: React 18, TypeScript, Express.js 4.x
- Supporting: Redux Toolkit, React Router, Axios, Material-UI

**Key Responsibilities**:
- User authentication via JWT tokens
- Form validation and user input sanitization
- API request/response handling
- Client-side routing
- Session storage management

**Communication Patterns**:
- Inbound: HTTPS requests from web browsers and mobile apps
- Outbound: REST API calls to Application tier (Node.js services)
- Protocols: HTTPS/REST, JSON payload format

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- Performance: <2s initial page load, <500ms API responses
- Availability: 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours/year downtime)
- Scalability: Load-balanced across 3+ instances, CDN for static assets

### Tier 2: Application/Business Logic Layer

## Guidelines

1. **All 3 tiers are required** in 3-Tier architecture
2. **Document tiers in order**: Presentation → Application/Business Logic → Data
3. **Each tier must include all subsections**: Purpose, Components, Technologies, Key Responsibilities, Communication Patterns, Non-Functional Requirements
4. **Separation of concerns**: Strictly separate UI logic, business logic, and data access
5. **Stateless middle tier**: Application tier should be stateless to enable horizontal scaling
6. **Data tier isolation**: Only Application tier should communicate with Data tier (no direct database access from Presentation)
