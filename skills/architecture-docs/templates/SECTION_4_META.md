# Section 4: Meta Architecture - META 6-Layer Enterprise Model

<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE: META -->

**Purpose**: Define the layered architecture model that organizes system components according to their responsibilities and functions.

This template follows the **META 6-Layer Enterprise Architecture** model, designed for large enterprise systems with complex integrations and regulatory compliance requirements.

**BIAN Standard**: This template uses **BIAN V12.0** as the default and recommended version for Layer 5 (Domain) service domain modeling. See the [BIAN Service Landscape V12.0](https://bian.org/servicelandscape-12-0-0/views/view_51891.html) for official service domain definitions.

- **Dashed arrows (`-.->`)**: Asynchronous events (Kafka, message queues)

**Colors**:
- **Blue**: Entry points, schedulers
- **Orange**: Workers, executors
- **Green**: Query services, read models

### Customization Instructions

To customize this diagram for your specific architecture:

1. **Update Layer Components**: Replace example components with your actual services
2. **Update Protocols**: Modify data flow labels with your actual protocols and security
3. **Update BIAN Service Domains**: Replace SD-003, SD-045 with your BIAN identifiers
4. **Adjust Colors**: Modify the `classDef` styling to match your organization's standards
5. **Add/Remove Flows**: Update arrow connections based on your integration patterns

**For detailed diagram creation and update instructions**, see [MERMAID_DIAGRAMS_GUIDE.md](../MERMAID_DIAGRAMS_GUIDE.md).

## Guidelines

1. **All 6 layers are required** in META architecture
2. **Document layers in order**: Channels → UX → Business Scenarios → Business → Domain → Core
3. **Each layer must include all subsections**: Purpose, Components, Technologies, Key Responsibilities, Communication Patterns, Non-Functional Requirements
4. **Flow direction**: Requests typically flow top-down (Channels → Core), responses flow bottom-up
5. **Integration points**: Clearly define how each layer communicates with adjacent layers
6. **BIAN compliance**: Layer 4 (Business) should ensure BIAN N2 compliance; Layer 5 (Domain) should align with BIAN v12 Service Domain model
7. **ISO20022 customization**: Layer 5 (Domain) should allow customization under ISO20022 standard if necessary
8. **Modernization strategy**: Layer 6 (Core) should include plans for progressive legacy system evolution
