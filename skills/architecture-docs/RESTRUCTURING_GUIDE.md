# Architecture Documentation — Multi-File Structure Guide

> Canonical reference for the `docs/` directory structure used by all new architecture documentation.

## Overview

All architecture documentation uses a multi-file structure from day one:
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** at the project root is the navigation index only (~130 lines)
- **`docs/`** contains all section content as numbered Markdown files
- **`docs/components/`** contains one file per architectural component (Section 5)
- **`adr/`** is unchanged — existing ADR workflow applies

---

## Standard Directory Structure

```
<project-root>/
├── ARCHITECTURE.md              (~130 lines — navigation index only)
├── adr/                         (existing ADR workflow — unchanged)
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ADR-NNN-*.md
└── docs/
    ├── 01-system-overview.md                 (Sections 1+2: Executive Summary + System Overview)
    ├── 02-architecture-principles.md         (Section 3: Architecture Principles)
    ├── 03-architecture-layers.md             (Section 4: Architecture Layers + Mermaid diagram)
    ├── 04-data-flow-patterns.md              (Section 6: Data Flow Patterns)
    ├── 05-integration-points.md              (Section 7: Integration Points)
    ├── 06-technology-stack.md                (Section 8: Technology Stack)
    ├── 07-security-architecture.md           (Section 9: Security Architecture)
    ├── 08-scalability-and-performance.md     (Section 10: Scalability & Performance)
    ├── 09-operational-considerations.md      (Section 11: Operational Considerations)
    ├── 10-references.md                      (References)
    └── components/
        ├── README.md                         (Component index — links to all component files)
        └── NN-<component-name>.md            (One file per Section 5 component)
```

**All files should be under ~400 lines each.**

---

## File Naming Convention

- Numbered docs files: `NN-kebab-case-section-name.md` (e.g., `01-system-overview.md`)
- Component files: `NN-<component-name>.md` (e.g., `01-api-gateway.md`, `02-payment-service.md`)
- Numbers are two-digit zero-padded (01, 02, ... 10, 11)
- Use lowercase kebab-case only — no spaces, no uppercase

---

## ARCHITECTURE.md Navigation Index Template

After creating all `docs/` files, `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the project root should use this shape:

```markdown
# <System Name> — Architecture

> <One-line system description>

## Documentation

| # | Section | File | Description |
|---|---------|------|-------------|
| S1+S2 | Executive Summary & System Overview | [docs/01-system-overview.md](docs/01-system-overview.md) | Problem, solution, use cases, key metrics |
| S3 | Architecture Principles | [docs/02-architecture-principles.md](docs/02-architecture-principles.md) | Design principles with trade-offs |
| S4 | Architecture Layers | [docs/03-architecture-layers.md](docs/03-architecture-layers.md) | Architecture model, layer diagram |
| S5 | Component Details | [docs/components/README.md](docs/components/README.md) | All components |
| S6 | Data Flow Patterns | [docs/04-data-flow-patterns.md](docs/04-data-flow-patterns.md) | Async execution flows |
| S7 | Integration Points | [docs/05-integration-points.md](docs/05-integration-points.md) | External integrations |
| S8 | Technology Stack | [docs/06-technology-stack.md](docs/06-technology-stack.md) | Libraries, versions, tools |
| S9 | Security Architecture | [docs/07-security-architecture.md](docs/07-security-architecture.md) | Threat model, controls, compliance |
| S10 | Scalability & Performance | [docs/08-scalability-and-performance.md](docs/08-scalability-and-performance.md) | HPA, latency targets, capacity |
| S11 | Operational Considerations | [docs/09-operational-considerations.md](docs/09-operational-considerations.md) | Deployment, DR, monitoring, costs |

> **Note**: The `#` column uses internal section numbers (S-prefix), not file prefix numbers.
> File prefix `07` = S9 (Security Architecture). File prefix `09` = S11 (Operational Considerations).
> See ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md for the full S1-S12 → file path canonical mapping.

## Architecture Decision Records

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [ADR-001](adr/ADR-001-<title>.md) | <Title> | Accepted |

See [adr/README.md](adr/README.md) for ADR process · [References](docs/10-references.md)
```

---

## Breadcrumb Convention

Add a breadcrumb at the top of every `docs/components/` file:

```markdown
[Architecture](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) > [Components](README.md) > <Component Name>
```

---

## Cross-Reference Conventions

**Never use bare `(Section X.Y)` references** — always use relative Markdown links.

| Context | ADR links | Section links | Component links |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| From `docs/` files | `../adr/ADR-NNN-name.md` | `NN-name.md` (same dir) | `components/NN-name.md` |
| From `docs/components/` files | `../../adr/ADR-NNN-name.md` | `../NN-name.md` | `NN-name.md` (same dir) |

Examples:
- In `docs/04-data-flow-patterns.md`: `See [Job Scheduler Service](components/01-job-scheduler-service.md)`
- In `docs/components/01-job-scheduler-service.md`: `See [Integration Points](../05-integration-points.md#section-header)`
- ADR from docs/: `See [ADR-001](../adr/ADR-001-scheduler.md)`
- ADR from docs/components/: `See [ADR-001](../../adr/ADR-001-scheduler.md)`

> **Enforcement**: The Foundational Context Anchor Protocol (SKILL.md) requires
> that all derived claims in downstream sections (S4–S11) carry cross-reference
> links using these conventions. See Source Attribution Rules in SKILL.md for
> the required citation format per claim type.

## Verification Checklist

After creating or migrating to the multi-file structure:

- [ ] **Heading inventory** — every `##`/`###` heading from the source appears in exactly one destination file
- [ ] **Code block parity** — every file has an even number of ` ``` ` fences (no split fenced blocks)
- [ ] **Link check** — run `markdown-link-check` or `lychee` on all `docs/` files and `ARCHITECTURE.md`; zero broken links
- [ ] **Mermaid render** — Mermaid diagram in `docs/03-architecture-layers.md` renders correctly in GitHub/GitLab
- [ ] **Spot-check cross-refs** — verify component files and section files have valid relative links (no bare `Section X.Y` references)
- [ ] **ADR link depth** — all ADR links from inside `docs/` use `../adr/` prefix; from inside `docs/components/` use `../../adr/`
- [ ] **Navigation index** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` contains only the nav table + ADR table (~130 lines), no section content
- [ ] `adr/README.md` updated if it referenced `ARCHITECTURE.md` sections by line number
- [ ] `compliance-docs/COMPLIANCE_MANIFEST.md` checked for stale section/line references
- [ ] **Source attribution** — downstream section edits include cross-reference links for derived metrics, ADR decisions, and principle-driven choices (see Source Attribution Rules in SKILL.md)
- [ ] **Change propagation** — after editing any section, review the Change Propagation Detection table (SKILL.md) to identify downstream sections that may need review
