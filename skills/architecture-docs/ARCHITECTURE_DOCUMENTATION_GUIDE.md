# Architecture Documentation Guide

> A comprehensive guide for creating system architecture documentation ARCHITECTURE.md

## Purpose

This guide provides a structured approach to documenting complex system architectures. Incorporates industry best practices for technical documentation.

**Use this guide when:**
- Starting a new system architecture from scratch
- Documenting an existing system's architecture
- Standardizing architecture documentation across multiple projects
- Onboarding teams to a new system
- Communicating architecture decisions to stakeholders

## Related Documentation

This guide focuses on **what to write** and **how to structure** architecture documentation content.

For supporting operations and algorithms:
- **→ SKILL.md**: Operational workflows, when to trigger actions, context-efficient editing strategies
- **→ METRIC_CALCULATIONS.md**: Algorithms for index updates and metric consistency detection
- **→ DESIGN_DRIVER_CALCULATIONS.md**: Implementation details for Design Drivers calculation
- **→ VALIDATIONS.md**: Structure enforcement rules, required principles, section name validation
- **→ ADR_GUIDE.md**: Architectural Decision Record format and creation guidelines
- **→ RESTRUCTURING_GUIDE.md**: Multi-file docs/ directory structure, naming conventions, cross-reference conventions, verification checklist

## C4 Model Alignment

Components in this architecture follow the **C4 model** (IcePanel convention):

### C4 Level 1 — Systems
Systems are logical groups of applications and data stores, typically owned by a single development team. In multi-system architectures, each system becomes a **folder** under `docs/components/`.

### C4 Level 2 — Containers
Each component file represents a **container** — a separately deployable/runnable unit. Containers are classified as:

| Type | C4 Category | Examples |
|------|------------|---------|
| API Service | App | REST API, GraphQL server, gRPC service |
| Web Application | App | SPA, SSR frontend, admin portal |
| Worker/Consumer | App | Message consumer, background processor, scheduler |
| Database | Store | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server |
| Cache | Store | Redis, Memcached |
| Message Broker | Store | Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus |
| Object Storage | Store | S3, Azure Blob, MinIO |
| Gateway | App | API Gateway, reverse proxy, load balancer |

### Boundary Test
Before creating a component file, verify:
- "Can this be deployed independently?" → YES = valid container
- "Does this run as its own process/container?" → YES = valid container
- Code module inside a deployable → NOT a container (C3 level — document within parent)
- External system you don't own → NOT a container (reference in integration docs)

### Naming Convention (IcePanel)
- Technology in brackets: `[Spring Boot 3.2]`, `[PostgreSQL 16]`, `[React 18 SPA]`
- Communication protocols on relationships: HTTPS, gRPC, AMQP, TCP

## Architecture Type Selection

**Before creating your ARCHITECTURE.md, choose your architecture type.** The architecture type determines the structure and content of **Section 4 (Meta Architecture)** and **Section 5 (Component Details)**.

### Available Architecture Types

1. **META Architecture** - 6-layer enterprise model for large systems with complex integrations
2. **3-Tier Architecture** - Classic web application pattern (Presentation → Application → Data)
3. **Microservices Architecture** - Cloud-native distributed systems with independent services
4. **N-Layer Architecture** - Customizable patterns (DDD, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal)

### How to Select

When creating a new ARCHITECTURE.md, the skill will prompt you to select your architecture type. Refer to:
- **`templates/ARCHITECTURE_TYPE_SELECTOR.md`** - Decision guide with comparison matrix

### Type-Specific Templates

Each architecture type has dedicated templates:
- **Section 4 Templates**: `templates/SECTION_4_*.md` (layer/tier structure)
- **Section 5 Templates**: `templates/SECTION_5_*.md` (component organization)

The skill automatically loads the appropriate templates based on your selection.

### Changing Architecture Type

To change the architecture type of an existing ARCHITECTURE.md:
1. Re-invoke the skill and specify the new type
2. The skill will detect the change and update Sections 4 and 5
3. **Manual review required** to ensure component mappings align with new structure

## Document Structure Overview

A comprehensive architecture document follows this hierarchical structure. Each section is stored in its corresponding `docs/NN-name.md` file (see **RESTRUCTURING_GUIDE.md** for the full directory layout):

```
S1+S2. Executive Summary + System Overview → docs/01-system-overview.md  (S1 and S2 combined)
S3.    Architecture Principles             → docs/02-architecture-principles.md
S4.    Architecture Layers                 → docs/03-architecture-layers.md
S5.    Component Details                   → docs/components/NN-<component>.md  (one file per component)
S6.    Data Flow Patterns                  → docs/04-data-flow-patterns.md
S7.    Integration Points                  → docs/05-integration-points.md
S8.    Technology Stack                    → docs/06-technology-stack.md
S9.    Security Architecture               → docs/07-security-architecture.md
S10.   Scalability & Performance           → docs/08-scalability-and-performance.md
S11.   Operational Considerations          → docs/09-operational-considerations.md
S12.   Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)→ adr/ directory (separate files per ADR)
       References                          → docs/10-references.md
```

> **WARNING — Section numbers ≠ file prefix numbers.**
> Internal section numbers (S1-S12) identify content concepts. File prefix numbers (01-10) are filesystem ordering only. They do NOT align.
> - S9 (Security Architecture) = `docs/07-security-architecture.md` — **NOT** `docs/09-*`
> - `docs/09-operational-considerations.md` = S11 (Operational Considerations)
> - When a user says "update Section 9", resolve to S9 → `docs/07-security-architecture.md`
> Always use **S-prefix** to identify sections and **file paths** to identify files. Never assume file prefix NN = section number N.

**IMPORTANT**: Section names must match exactly as shown above. See the architecture-docs skill guide for strict section name enforcement rules.

**IMPORTANT**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the project root is the **navigation index only** (~130 lines). All section content lives in the `docs/` files listed above.

---

## Explorer-Friendly Headers (v3.14.0)

Every newly-created or edited `docs/NN-*.md` section file and `docs/components/**/*.md` component file MUST include an **Explorer Header** — a 5–10 line block placed immediately after the H1 title that surfaces the doc's key concepts, terms, technologies, and component names.

### Why

The plugin's `architecture-explorer` agent (Haiku-tier classifier, `agents/builders/architecture-explorer.md`) reads only the first 60 lines + section headings of each candidate file when deciding whether the file is relevant to a downstream task (compliance, analysis, peer-review, handoff, Q&A, ADR application). If the load-bearing terms only appear deep in the body, the explorer can miss them and route the file to `irrelevant_files[]` — costing the downstream agent a documentation gap. A short, dense header in the first 60 lines maximizes the explorer's classification accuracy.

`ARCHITECTURE.md` at the project root is exempt — it is a navigation index, read in full, no header needed.

### Format

Place the header between the H1 and the first regular section. Use this exact frontmatter-style fence so it is easy for the explorer to find and ignore the body of the doc when scoring:

```markdown
# Section 8: Scalability & Performance

<!-- EXPLORER_HEADER
key_concepts: SLO, SLI, MTTR, error budget, HPA, auto-scaling, p95, p99
technologies: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog
components: api-gateway, payment-service, inbox-hub
scope: Service-level objectives, horizontal pod autoscaling, latency budgets
related_adrs: ADR-014, ADR-022
-->

> One-paragraph summary of what this doc covers, written for a reader who needs to decide in 30 seconds whether to read the full doc.

## 8.1 Service Level Objectives
...
```

Field guidance:

- **key_concepts** — comma-separated list of 5–15 domain terms a downstream synthesis agent would search for. Pull from the doc's actual content. Match the vocabulary in `agents/configs/explorer/<task_type>.json` `relevance_keywords.boost[]` where applicable.
- **technologies** — concrete tools/products named in the doc (Prometheus, AWS, Kubernetes, Spring Boot, etc.). Skip generic terms like "database" or "API".
- **components** — kebab-case component names referenced in the doc, matching `docs/components/<NN>-<slug>.md` filenames.
- **scope** — one short sentence (≤120 chars) explaining what the doc covers and what it explicitly does NOT cover.
- **related_adrs** — ADR identifiers (ADR-NNN) whose decisions are reflected in this doc. Helps the explorer's ADR intersection logic.

The trailing `>` blockquote is the **30-second summary** — a human-readable distillation that complements the machine-readable header. It is also surfaced to the explorer (it lives within the first 60 lines) and to humans skimming the doc.

### What goes in `docs/components/NN-<slug>.md`

Component files follow the same rule with one variation — the `components` field is replaced by `component_self`:

```markdown
# Payment Service

<!-- EXPLORER_HEADER
key_concepts: PCI compliance, idempotency, refund, chargeback, settlement
technologies: Spring Boot 3.3, PostgreSQL 16, Stripe API
component_self: payment-service
component_type: api-service
related_adrs: ADR-018, ADR-031
-->

> Payment Service ingests authorization requests from the order-checkout flow, calls the Stripe API for capture/refund/void operations, and persists ledger entries with idempotency guarantees.

## Component Metadata
...
```

### Maintenance

When you edit a doc, update the EXPLORER_HEADER if the change adds/removes a key concept, technology, or component reference. Stale headers are worse than missing ones — they actively mislead the classifier. The header is part of the doc's source-of-truth, not a derived index.

### Backwards compatibility

Legacy docs without an EXPLORER_HEADER continue to work — the explorer falls back to scoring against headings + body sample. There is no breaking change. The header simply boosts classification accuracy for new and updated docs going forward.

---

## Document Index & Navigation

**Purpose**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` serves as the navigation index — a short (~130 lines) table linking to all `docs/NN-name.md` section files. This replaces the old line-number-based Document Index.

Every project should have `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the project root containing:
- A Documentation table linking to each `docs/` file
- An ADR table linking to each `adr/` file
- Nothing else (no section content)

This enables:
- Quick navigation to specific sections by following file links
- Context-efficient editing — read only the target `docs/` file (50–400 lines each)
- Easy maintenance — edits go to individual `docs/` files, not a monolithic document

### Navigation Index Template

`ARCHITECTURE.md` should follow the template in **RESTRUCTURING_GUIDE.md** (`ARCHITECTURE.md Navigation Index Template` section). Key shape:

```markdown
# <System Name> — Architecture

> <One-line system description>

## Documentation

| # | Section | File | Description |
|---|---------|------|-------------|
| S1+S2 | Executive Summary & System Overview | [docs/01-system-overview.md](docs/01-system-overview.md) | ... |
...

## Architecture Decision Records

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [ADR-001](adr/ADR-001-name.md) | Title | Accepted |
```

### How to Navigate

**When Reading:**
1. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` in full (it's ~130 lines — no offset needed)
2. Find your target section in the Documentation table
3. Read the linked `docs/NN-name.md` file in full (50–400 lines — no offset needed)

**When Editing:**
- Edit the target `docs/NN-name.md` file directly
- Only update `ARCHITECTURE.md` when adding, removing, or renaming a `docs/` file

### Context Guidelines

With the multi-file structure, context management is straightforward:

| Operation | What to Read | Approx Lines |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Find target section | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | ~130 |
| Edit one section | 1 `docs/` file | ~50–400 |
| Edit component | 1 `docs/components/` file | ~40–200 |
| Full architecture review | All `docs/` files | ~2,000–3,500 |

### Foundational Context & Source Attribution Requirement

Architecture documentation follows a dependency hierarchy. Sections 1+2 (System Overview), Section 3 (Architecture Principles), and ADRs form the **Tier 0 foundation** — the source of truth for all downstream content. Sections 4–11 are derived content organized in tiers:

- **Tier 1**: S4 (Layers) — derives from S1+2, S3, ADRs
- **Tier 2**: S5 (Components) — derives from foundation + S4
- **Tier 3**: S6 (Data Flow), S7 (Integration), S8 (Tech Stack) — derive from foundation + S5 and/or S4
- **Tier 4**: S9 (Security), S10 (Scalability) — derive from foundation + S5, S7, S8
- **Tier 5**: S11 (Operations) — derives from foundation + S5, S8, S10

**Source Attribution Rule**: Every claim in a downstream section that originates from another section MUST carry a cross-reference link to its source. Metrics repeated from S1 Key Metrics, design choices governed by ADRs, and constraints from S3 principles must include traceable citations (e.g., `(see [Key Metrics](01-system-overview.md#key-metrics))`, `per [ADR-003](../adr/ADR-003-title.md))`).

**Unverifiable Claims**: If a specific claim (metric, decision, constraint) cannot be traced to an existing section, user input, or ADR, insert a `<!-- TODO: Add source reference -->` marker. These markers signal content that needs sourcing during review.

For the full dependency map, loading procedure, and citation format table, see the **Foundational Context Anchor Protocol** in SKILL.md.

## Section 1: Executive Summary

**Purpose**: High-level overview for executives and stakeholders.

**Important**: Section 1 (Executive Summary) and Section 2 (System Overview) are combined in `docs/01-system-overview.md`. The `ARCHITECTURE.md` file at the project root is the navigation index only — it does not contain section content.

**Complete Template (Including Index):**
```markdown
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_VERSION: 1.0.0 -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_STATUS: Draft -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_RELEASED: YYYY-MM-DD -->

# [System Name] - [Tagline]

> [One-paragraph mission statement]

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Draft | Released | Deprecated
**Released**: YYYY-MM-DD (leave empty while Status: Draft)
**Architect**: [Name or Team]
**Supersedes**: — (or: v0.9.0)

<!-- Navigation index lives in ARCHITECTURE.md at the project root (see
     RESTRUCTURING_GUIDE.md → "ARCHITECTURE.md Navigation Index Template").
     This file (docs/01-system-overview.md) contains Sections 1+2 only. -->

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### System Overview

[System description paragraph]

**Key Metrics:**

#### Read TPS
- **Average Read TPS**: [Value] transactions/second
- **Peak Read TPS**: [Value] transactions/second
- **Measurement Period**: [Time frame for measurements, e.g., "Average over last 30 days in production; Peak observed during Black Friday 2024"]

#### Processing TPS
- **Average Processing TPS**: [Value] transactions/second
- **Peak Processing TPS**: [Value] transactions/second
- **Measurement Period**: [Time frame for measurements, e.g., "Average over last quarter; Peak during end-of-month batch processing"]

#### Write TPS
- **Average Write TPS**: [Value] transactions/second
- **Peak Write TPS**: [Value] transactions/second
- **Measurement Period**: [Time frame for measurements, e.g., "Average over last month; Peak during data migration events"]

**Additional Metrics:**
- **Availability SLA**: [Value]% uptime
- **Latency Targets**: p95 < [Value]ms, p99 < [Value]ms
- **[Other Metric]**: [Value and context]

**Technology Stack:** [Primary technologies: language, framework, cloud platform]

**Deployment:** [Cloud provider, orchestration platform, deployment model]

**Business Value:**
- **Value Proposition 1**: [Impact statement]
- **Value Proposition 2**: [Impact statement]
- **Value Proposition 3**: [Impact statement]
```

**Maintaining the Navigation Index:**

1. **Initial Creation**: Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the project root using the Navigation Index Template (see RESTRUCTURING_GUIDE.md → "ARCHITECTURE.md Navigation Index Template").
2. **When Adding a Section File**: Add a new row to the Documentation table in `ARCHITECTURE.md` with the S-prefix, title, file link, and one-line description.
3. **When Renaming or Removing a File**: Update the matching row (or remove it) in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Do not leave dangling links.
4. **ADR Table**: Add a row to the Architecture Decision Records table when a new ADR is accepted; let `architecture-definition-record` manage status changes.
5. **No line numbers required**: The multi-file structure reads each `docs/NN-*.md` file in full (50–400 lines), so line ranges are not tracked or maintained.

---

### Architecture Versioning

Every `ARCHITECTURE.md` carries a **semantic version** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) in the header metadata block. This version is the canonical reference for all downstream artifacts (compliance contracts, handoffs, traceability reports).

**Metadata block format**:

```markdown
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_VERSION: 1.2.0 -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_STATUS: Released -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_RELEASED: 2026-04-08 -->

# [System Name] - [Tagline]

> [One-paragraph mission statement]

**Version**: 1.2.0
**Status**: Released
**Released**: 2026-04-08
**Architect**: Platform Architecture Team
**Supersedes**: v1.1.0
```

**Semver rules for architecture docs**:
- **MAJOR** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking structural changes — new system added, architecture type changed, core principles changed, major ADR superseded
- **MINOR** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New components, new sections, new integrations, new ADRs accepted
- **PATCH** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Corrections, clarifications, metric updates, typo fixes

**Status values**:
- `Draft` — work in progress; not yet ready for compliance or handoff consumers
- `Released` — frozen baseline; compliance contracts and handoffs should reference this version
- `Deprecated` — superseded by a newer version; retained for historical reference

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Initial creation** → `v1.0.0` / Status: `Draft` (no `Released` date)
2. **First release** → Status: `Released` + `Released: YYYY-MM-DD`
3. **Minor update** → bump to `v1.1.0`, re-release
4. **Breaking change** → bump to `v2.0.0`, set `Supersedes: v1.X.X`

**Per-component versions** (in `docs/components/**/*.md`): Each component file carries its own `Component Version` alongside the parent `Architecture Version`. See Section 5 for the component header template.

**CHANGELOG**: All released versions are documented in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with Added / Changed / Deprecated / Superseded sections (Keep a Changelog format).

**Git tag (when repo is under version control)**: Each released version MUST be tagged as `architecture-v{version}` (e.g., `architecture-v1.2.0`). The tag is namespaced to distinguish from plugin/app version tags.

---

## Section 2: System Overview

**Purpose**: Context about the problem, solution, and key use cases.

**Template:**
```markdown
## System Overview

### Problem Statement
[Industry/domain] faces challenges with [specific problem]. Current solutions suffer from [pain points].

### Solution
[System name] addresses this by [approach]. Key differentiators: [3-5 bullet points]

### Design Drivers

This architecture is driven by the following key factors:

#### Value Delivery
**Description**: Effectiveness of change in customer experience
- **Threshold**: >50% = High Impact, ≤50% = Low Impact
- **Current Assessment**: [HIGH / LOW] Impact
- **Justification**: [Specific percentage or business value metric from Section 1 Executive Summary]
- **Example**: "System delivers 70% cost reduction (see [Key Metrics](01-system-overview.md#key-metrics))" → HIGH

#### Scale
**Description**: Estimated number of customers impacted
- **Threshold**: >100K = High, ≤100K = Low
- **Current Assessment**: [HIGH / LOW] Impact
- **Justification**: [Specific customer/transaction volume from Section 2.3 Use Cases]
- **Example**: "System impacts 500,000 customers/day (see [Primary Use Cases](01-system-overview.md#primary-use-cases))" → HIGH

#### Impacts
**Description**: Implementation complexity across configuration, development, and applications
- **Threshold**: >5 = High, ≤5 = Low
- **Current Assessment**: [HIGH / LOW] Impact
- **Justification**: [Component count from Section 5 + Technology count from Section 8]
- **Example**: "System requires 8 components/technologies (see [Components](components/README.md) + [Technology Stack](06-technology-stack.md))" → HIGH

**Last Calculated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Calculation Method**: [Automatic / Manual Override]

**Note**: Design Drivers can be automatically calculated using the architecture-docs skill during architecture reviews. The skill will extract metrics from Sections 1, 2.3, 5, and 8 to determine impact levels.

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Use Case 1**: [Description]
2. **Use Case 2**: [Description]
3. **Use Case 3**: [Description]
```

**Design Drivers Guidance:**

The Design Drivers subsection provides a quantifiable assessment of the architecture's impact across three dimensions. This helps justify architecture complexity and communicate value to stakeholders.

### What Design Drivers Measure

Design Drivers assess architecture impact using three quantifiable dimensions:

**1. Value Delivery - Effectiveness of Change**

Measures the effectiveness of the change from a customer experience perspective.

- **Threshold**: >50% = HIGH Impact, ≤50% = LOW Impact
- **Data Source**: Section 1 Executive Summary, Business Value bullets
- **What to Look For**: Percentage improvements in cost reduction, efficiency gains, time savings, productivity increases, or customer satisfaction metrics
- **Examples**:
  - "70% cost reduction" → HIGH (70% > 50%)
  - "45% time savings" → LOW (45% ≤ 50%)
  - "60% efficiency improvement" → HIGH (60% > 50%)

**Calculation Approach**:
1. Review Section 1 Business Value bullets for percentage metrics
2. Identify the maximum percentage value
3. Compare to 50% threshold
4. Include source line number in justification

**2. Scale - Breadth of Impact**

Measures the estimated number of customers or transactions impacted by the system.

- **Threshold**: >100,000 = HIGH Impact, ≤100,000 = LOW Impact
- **Data Source**: Section 2.3 Use Cases, Success Metrics subsections
- **What to Look For**: Daily/monthly volumes for customers, users, transactions, payments, jobs, or events processed
- **Examples**:
  - "500,000+ reminders per day" → HIGH (500,000 > 100,000)
  - "50,000 customers" → LOW (50,000 ≤ 100,000)
  - "1,000,000 transactions/month" → HIGH (1M > 100K)

**Calculation Approach**:
1. Review Section 2.3 Success Metrics for volume indicators
2. Extract customer counts, transaction volumes, daily/monthly throughput
3. Identify the maximum volume
4. Compare to 100,000 threshold
5. Include source line number in justification

**3. Impacts - Implementation Complexity**

Measures implementation complexity by counting architectural components and technologies.

- **Threshold**: >5 total = HIGH Impact, ≤5 total = LOW Impact
- **Data Sources**: Section 5 (Component Details) + Section 8 (Technology Stack)
- **What to Count**:
  - Components: Count ### subsection headers in Section 5 (e.g., ### 5.1, 5.2, 5.3)
  - Technologies: Count technology table rows in Section 8 (excluding headers)
  - Total: Component count + Technology count
- **Examples**:
  - 5 components + 3 technologies = 8 total → HIGH (8 > 5)
  - 3 components + 2 technologies = 5 total → LOW (5 ≤ 5)
  - 6 components + 0 technologies = 6 total → HIGH (6 > 5)

**Calculation Approach**:
1. Count component subsections in Section 5 (pattern: `^###\s+\d+\.\d+`)
2. Count technology table rows in Section 8 (exclude headers and separators)
3. Sum the counts
4. Compare to 5 threshold
5. Provide breakdown in justification

### Why Design Drivers Matter

Design Drivers provide quantifiable justification for:
- **Architecture Complexity**: "8 components/technologies" explains why the solution is sophisticated
- **Investment Level**: "500,000 customers/day" justifies infrastructure costs and engineering resources
- **Business Value**: "70% cost reduction" demonstrates ROI and strategic importance

**Use Cases**:
- Architecture reviews and audits
- Stakeholder presentations and buy-in
- Budget justification and resource allocation
- Validating architecture decisions against business goals
- Quarterly architecture assessments

### When to Calculate

**Manual Assessment** (Initial Documentation):
- When creating Section 2 during initial architecture documentation
- Review Section 1, Section 2.3, Section 5, and Section 8
- Manually extract metrics and apply thresholds
- Document assessment with source line numbers

**Automatic Calculation** (Architecture Reviews):
- During architecture reviews or audits
- After significant architecture changes
- When explicitly requested: "calculate design drivers"
- Skill automatically extracts metrics and applies thresholds
- Presents results for user review and approval

### Automation Support

The architecture-docs skill includes a Design Drivers calculation workflow that:

**What It Does**:
1. **Extracts Metrics**: Automatically reads Section 1, 2.3, 5, and 8
2. **Applies Algorithms**: Uses regex patterns and counting logic to extract percentages, volumes, and component counts
3. **Determines Impact Levels**: Compares extracted values to thresholds (50%, 100K, 5)
4. **Generates Justifications**: Creates human-readable justifications with source line numbers
5. **Presents for Review**: Shows calculation report before making any changes
6. **Updates Document**: After user approval, updates Section 2.2.1 with calculated values

**Context Efficiency**:
- Loads only required sections (not entire document)
- Achieves 75-80% context reduction vs. full document load
- Sequential section loading for minimal memory footprint

**How to Trigger**:
- Request "architecture review"
- Explicitly ask to "calculate design drivers"
- Skill automatically prompts during architecture audits

**Implementation Details**:
For detailed extraction algorithms, edge case handling, and calculation logic, see:
→ **DESIGN_DRIVER_CALCULATIONS.md** § Algorithm 1, 2, 3

For operational workflows and when to trigger calculations, see:
→ **SKILL.md** § Design Drivers Workflow

### Threshold Edge Cases

**Exactly at Threshold**:
- 50% exactly → LOW Impact (threshold is >50%, not ≥50%)
- 100,000 exactly → LOW Impact (threshold is >100K, not ≥100K)
- 5 exactly → LOW Impact (threshold is >5, not ≥5)
- These cases are flagged for user review with a note

**Multiple Metrics**:
- If multiple percentages exist (e.g., 70%, 45%, 60%), use the maximum (70%)
- If multiple volumes exist (e.g., 500K customers, 1M transactions), use the maximum (1M)
- Rationale: Assess overall impact based on strongest metric

**Missing Data**:
- If no percentage metrics found in Section 1 → Default to LOW with note "No quantifiable metrics found"
- If no volume metrics in Section 2.3 → Default to LOW with note "No volume metrics found"
- If Section 5 or 8 missing → Calculate with available data, note missing section

### Manual Override

Users can override any calculated value:
- Change impact level (HIGH ↔ LOW)
- Provide custom justification
- Specify different threshold or metric
- Mark as "Manual Override" with reason and date

When manual override exists:
- Subsequent automatic calculations prompt before overwriting
- Preserve manual override unless user explicitly approves change
- Document override reason in "Calculation Method" field

## Visualizing Your Architecture

**Purpose**: Create visual representations of your architecture using Mermaid diagrams for improved clarity and communication.

### Why Use Mermaid Diagrams?

**Benefits over ASCII art or external diagram tools**:
- ✅ **Interactive**: Zoom, pan, and click components in rendered view
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Text-based, easy to update without manual alignment
- ✅ **Version Control Friendly**: Git diffs work seamlessly
- ✅ **GitHub/GitLab Native**: Renders automatically in markdown viewers
- ✅ **Professional**: Modern, polished appearance with color-coding
- ✅ **Accessible**: Screen readers can parse the underlying text

### When to Add Diagrams

**Section 4 (Architecture Layers/Tiers)**:
- **Required for**: Visual representation of layer/tier structure
- **Diagram Type**: Layer flow diagram using `graph TB` (top-to-bottom)
- **Shows**: Components grouped by layers, data flow between layers
- **Benefit**: Helps stakeholders quickly understand system organization

**Section 6 (Data Flow Patterns)**:
- **Recommended for**: Complex request/response flows
- **Diagram Type**: Sequence diagrams or flowcharts
- **Shows**: Step-by-step data movement through components
- **Benefit**: Clarifies integration patterns and communication protocols

### Quick Mermaid Syntax Reference

**Basic Structure** (Layer/Tier Diagram):
````markdown
```mermaid
graph TB
    %% Layer 1
    subgraph Layer1["Layer 1: Name"]
        Component1["Component Name<br/>Details"]
        Component2["Component Name<br/>Details"]
    end

    %% Layer 2
    subgraph Layer2["Layer 2: Name"]
        Component3["Component Name"]
    end

    %% Data flows
    Component1 -->|Protocol<br/>Security| Component3
    Component2 -.->|Async Event| Component3
```
````

## Section 3: Architecture Principles

**Purpose**: Guiding principles that drive architectural decisions.

**Required Principles (in order):**

All architecture documents must include these 9 core principles in this exact order:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **High Availability**: System remains operational during infrastructure failures
3. **Scalability First**: Design for horizontal scalability from day one
4. **Security by Design**: Security is not an afterthought
5. **Observability**: All components emit metrics, logs, and traces
6. **Resilience**: System degrades gracefully under failure
7. **Simplicity**: Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
8. **Cloud-Native**: Design for cloud deployment and orchestration
9. **Open Standards**: Prefer open standards over proprietary solutions

**Optional Principle:**

10. **Decouple Through Events**: *(Apply selectively where temporal independence and scalability are prioritized)*
    - Loose coupling via domain events
    - Asynchronous communication patterns

**Document Header Rule:**

The section heading must reflect the actual principle count:
- If only principles 1–9 are included: `## Architecture Principles (9 Core Principles)`
- If optional principle 10 is also included: `## Architecture Principles (10 Core Principles)`

**Template Structure:**

Each principle must follow this three-part structure:

```markdown
## Architecture Principles (9 Core Principles)

### 1. Separation of Concerns

**Description:**
Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility with clear boundaries between layers and modules.

**Implementation:**
- [How this principle is applied in your system]

**Trade-offs:**
- [Costs or downsides of implementing this principle]
- [Complexity introduced, performance impacts, etc.]

### 2. High Availability

**Description:**
System remains operational during infrastructure failures through redundancy and fault tolerance.

**Implementation:**
- [Your HA strategy: clustering, multi-zone deployment, etc.]
- [Specific configurations and technologies used]
- [Health checks, failover mechanisms]

**Trade-offs:**

Design for horizontal scalability from day one, enabling linear capacity scaling by adding resources.

**Implementation:**
- [Stateless services, auto-scaling configuration]
- [Specific scaling strategies and triggers]
- [Technologies used: Kubernetes HPA, load balancers, etc.]

**Trade-offs:**

### 5. Observability

**Description:**
All components emit metrics, logs, and traces to provide full visibility into system behavior and failures.

**Implementation:**
- [Logging strategy: structured logging, correlation IDs]
- [Metrics collection: Prometheus, CloudWatch, etc.]
- [Tracing: distributed tracing tools]
- [Dashboards and alerting setup]

**Trade-offs:**
- [Storage and processing overhead for metrics/logs]
- [Additional infrastructure cost]

### 6. Resilience

**Description:**
System degrades gracefully under failure with automatic handling of transient issues and isolation of persistent failures.

**Implementation:**
- [Retry strategies: exponential backoff]
- [Circuit breakers and bulkheads]
- [Timeouts and dead-letter queues]
- [Graceful degradation patterns]

**Trade-offs:**
- [Increased complexity in error handling logic]
- [Potential for delayed failure detection]

### 7. Simplicity

**Description:**
Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements, avoiding over-engineering and unnecessary complexity.

**Implementation:**
- [Technology choices favoring simplicity]
- [Design patterns chosen for clarity]

**Implementation:**
- [Container orchestration: Kubernetes, ECS, etc.]
- [Cloud services utilized: managed databases, message queues]
- [Infrastructure as Code approach]
- [12-factor app principles applied]

**Trade-offs:**

- [Cloud provider dependency]

### 9. Open Standards

**Description:**
Prefer open standards over proprietary solutions to ensure interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in.

**Implementation:**
- [Standard protocols: REST, gRPC, OpenAPI]
- [Open source technologies chosen]
- [Industry standards followed]

**Trade-offs:**
- [May miss proprietary optimizations]
- [Potential performance trade-offs]

### 10. Decouple Through Events *(Optional - apply selectively)*

**Description:**
Use asynchronous domain events to decouple components where temporal independence and scalability are prioritized over immediate consistency.

**Implementation:**
- **Synchronous Patterns**: [Describe where sync APIs are used, e.g., REST for user-facing operations]
- **Asynchronous Patterns**: [Describe where async events are used, e.g., Kafka for background processing]
- [Consumer groups, idempotency, schema management]

**When to Use Async:**
- [Scenarios where async is appropriate, e.g., background jobs, notifications]

**When to Use Sync:**
- [Scenarios requiring sync, e.g., user-facing APIs, immediate feedback needed]

**Trade-offs:**
- Eventual consistency requires careful handling in business logic
- Increased debugging complexity for async flows
- Not all interactions benefit from async (user-facing APIs need immediate responses)
- [Additional trade-offs specific to your implementation]
```

**Important Notes:**

- All 9 core principles are **required** in every ARCHITECTURE.md
- Principles must appear in the **exact order** listed above
- Each principle must include all three subsections: **Description**, **Implementation**, and **Trade-offs**
- The **Implementation** section must be customized with system-specific details (not generic placeholders)
- The **Trade-offs** section must honestly assess the costs and downsides
- Decouple Through Events (principle #10) is **optional** and should only be included where asynchronous patterns provide clear benefits for temporal decoupling and scalability

## Section 12: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Purpose**: Document key architectural decisions in separate ADR files.

Architecture decisions should be documented using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). For complete guidance on creating and managing ADRs, see [ADR_GUIDE.md](ADR_GUIDE.md).

**Template:**
```markdown
## Architecture Decision Records

Architectural decisions are documented in ADRs. See [ADR_GUIDE.md](ADR_GUIDE.md) for the complete ADR template and guidelines.

### Active ADRs

| ID | Title | Status | Date | Impact |
|----|-------|--------|------|--------|
| [ADR-001](adr/ADR-001.md) | [Title] | Accepted | YYYY-MM-DD | High/Medium/Low |
```

**Automatic ADR File Generation**:

When using the architecture-docs skill to create ARCHITECTURE.md, you will be prompted to automatically generate these ADR files. The skill will:
- Read the table above
- Create each ADR file in the `adr/` directory
- Populate metadata (title, status, date) from the table
- Use the standard template (`adr/ADR-000-template.md`)

You can skip automatic generation and create ADRs manually as architectural decisions are made. To add ADRs later, simply update this table and manually create the files using the template.

For complete ADR creation guide and template details, see: [ADR_GUIDE.md](ADR_GUIDE.md)
