# Architecture Documentation Validations

> Enforcement rules and validation checklists for ARCHITECTURE.md structure and content

## Purpose

This document defines validation rules for:
1. **Architecture Principles Enforcement** (Section 3)
2. **Section Name Enforcement** (All 12 sections)
3. **Document Structure Validation**

These rules ensure consistency and completeness across all ARCHITECTURE.md documents.

## Related Documentation

## 1. Architecture Principles Enforcement (Section 3)

### Required Principles (Strict Order)

All ARCHITECTURE.md documents MUST include these **9 core principles** in this **exact order**:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
2. **High Availability**
3. **Scalability First**
4. **Security by Design**
5. **Observability**
6. **Resilience**
7. **Simplicity**
8. **Cloud-Native**
9. **Open Standards**

### Optional Principle

10. **Event-Driven Architecture** *(Include ONLY if the system actually uses event-driven patterns)*

**When to Include**:
- ✅ System uses message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS, etc.)
- ✅ System has event-driven workflows or event sourcing
- ✅ Components communicate primarily via events

**When to Omit**:
- ❌ System is purely synchronous request/response
- ❌ No event streaming or pub/sub patterns used
- ❌ Events are not a core architectural pattern

### Required Structure for Each Principle

Each principle MUST include these three subsections:

```markdown
### [Number]. [Principle Name]

**Description:**
[What this principle means - 1-2 sentences]

**Implementation:**
- [System-specific implementation details]
- [Technologies, patterns, configurations used]
- [Concrete examples from your architecture]

**Trade-offs:**
- [Costs, downsides, complexity introduced]
- [Performance impacts, infrastructure costs, etc.]
```

**Template Example**:

```markdown
### 3.1 Separation of Concerns

**Description:**
System components are organized into distinct layers and services, each with a single, well-defined responsibility.

**Implementation:**
- 6-layer Meta Architecture (Data, Integration, Core Logic, Process, Interface, Presentation)
- Microservices pattern: Job Scheduler Service, Job Executor Service, Notification Service
- Database segregation: PostgreSQL (operational data), Redis (caching/queuing)
- Clear boundaries between scheduling logic and execution logic

**Trade-offs:**
- Increased operational complexity (multiple services to deploy and monitor)
- Network latency between distributed components
- More complex debugging across service boundaries
- Requires service mesh or API gateway for communication management
```

### Validation Rules

When creating or updating Section 3, verify:

✅ **All 9 core principles are present**
- Check that principles 1-9 are all documented
- Verify no principles are missing

✅ **Principles appear in the exact order specified**
- Principle 1: Separation of Concerns (must be first)
- Principle 2: High Availability
- ...
- Principle 9: Open Standards (must be ninth)

✅ **Each principle has all three subsections**
- Description subsection exists
- Implementation subsection exists
- Trade-offs subsection exists

✅ **Implementation section contains system-specific details**
- NOT generic placeholders like "We use best practices"
- Specific technologies mentioned (e.g., "PostgreSQL", "Kubernetes", "Redis")
- Concrete examples from the actual architecture
- Configuration details or patterns used

✅ **Trade-offs section honestly assesses costs/downsides**
- Not just "None" or "Minimal"
- Real costs: performance impact, complexity, infrastructure costs
- Operational burdens: monitoring, debugging, deployment complexity
- Development overhead: additional code, testing requirements

✅ **Event-Driven Architecture (#10) only included if system uses it**
- Check if system has message queues or event streams
- Verify event-driven is a core pattern, not incidental
- If included, must have same three-subsection structure

✅ **No additional custom principles beyond the standard 9-10**
- If non-standard principles exist, map them to standard principles
- Or remove and incorporate content into appropriate standard principle

### Validation Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing Section 3:

```
Section 3: Architecture Principles Validation
════════════════════════════════════════════════

Principle Presence:
☐ 1. Separation of Concerns
☐ 2. High Availability
☐ 3. Scalability First
☐ 4. Security by Design
☐ 5. Observability
☐ 6. Resilience
☐ 7. Simplicity
☐ 8. Cloud-Native
☐ 9. Open Standards
☐ 10. Event-Driven Architecture (optional - only if applicable)

Structure Validation:
☐ All principles in exact order (1-9, optional 10)
☐ Each principle has "Description" subsection
☐ Each principle has "Implementation" subsection
☐ Each principle has "Trade-offs" subsection

Content Quality:
☐ Implementations are system-specific (not generic)
☐ Technologies and patterns explicitly named
☐ Trade-offs are realistic and honest
☐ No placeholder text ("TBD", "TODO", etc.)
☐ Event-Driven (#10) only if system uses events

Common Errors:
☐ No missing principles from core 9
☐ No reordered principles
☐ No single-sentence descriptions without structure
☐ No generic "best practices" placeholders
☐ No omitted Trade-offs sections
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Missing principles from the core 9**
- Example: Skipping "Simplicity" or "Open Standards"
- Fix: Add all 9 required principles

❌ **Changing the order of principles**
- Example: Putting "Security by Design" before "High Availability"
- Fix: Reorder to match standard sequence (1-9)

❌ **Using generic placeholder text in Implementation sections**
- Example: "We follow industry best practices for security"
- Fix: "OAuth 2.0 + JWT for authentication, TLS 1.3 for encryption, AWS WAF for application firewall"

❌ **Omitting Trade-offs section**
- Example: Only having Description and Implementation
- Fix: Add Trade-offs with honest assessment of costs

❌ **Including Event-Driven Architecture when system doesn't use it**
- Example: Synchronous REST API system lists Event-Driven principle
- Fix: Remove Event-Driven Architecture principle (#10)

❌ **Adding custom principles not in the standard list**
- Example: "11. Innovation" or "12. Customer-Centric Design"
- Fix: Remove or incorporate into relevant standard principle

❌ **Using single-sentence descriptions instead of structured format**
- Example: Just "### 3.1 Separation of Concerns - Components are separated"
- Fix: Use full three-subsection structure

### Updating Existing Documents

If an existing ARCHITECTURE.md has different principles:

**Step 1**: Identify missing principles
- Compare against the required 9
- List which principles are absent

**Step 2**: Re-order existing principles
- Match the standard order (1-9)
- Update numbering (3.1, 3.2, etc.)

**Step 3**: Add missing principles
- Write system-specific Implementation details
- Document real Trade-offs
- Use appropriate Description

**Step 4**: Restructure format
- Ensure each has Description/Implementation/Trade-offs
- Remove generic placeholders
- Add specific technologies and patterns

**Step 5**: Remove non-standard principles
- Either map to standard principles
- Or incorporate content into appropriate existing principle

**Step 6**: Preserve existing content
- Migrate good content to standard principles
- Don't delete valuable information
- Reorganize into standard structure

---

## 2. Section Name Enforcement

### Standard 12-Section Structure

All ARCHITECTURE.md documents MUST include these **12 sections** with these **exact names** in this **exact order**:

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **System Overview**
3. **Architecture Principles**
4. **Architecture Layers**
5. **Component Details**
6. **Data Flow Patterns** *(Optional - may be omitted for simple systems)*
7. **Integration Points**
8. **Technology Stack**
9. **Security Architecture**
10. **Scalability & Performance**
11. **Operational Considerations**
12. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**

### Markdown Header Format

Each section MUST use this exact format:

```markdown
## [NUMBER]. [SECTION NAME]
```

**Correct Examples**:
- ✅ `## 1. Executive Summary`
- ✅ `## 2. System Overview`
- ✅ `## 12. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)`

**Incorrect Examples**:
- ❌ `## Executive Summary` (missing number)
- ❌ `## 1 Executive Summary` (missing period after number)
- ❌ `## 12. ADR References` (wrong section name)
- ❌ `## 8. Tech Stack` (abbreviated name, should be "Technology Stack")
- ❌ `## 10. Performance` (incomplete name, should be "Scalability & Performance")

### Validation Rules

When creating or updating ARCHITECTURE.md, verify:

✅ **All 12 section headers match exactly (case-sensitive)**
- "Executive Summary" not "Executive summary"
- "Technology Stack" not "Tech Stack"
- "Security Architecture" not just "Security"
- "Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)" not "ADR References"

✅ **Sections appear in the exact order specified (1-12)**
- Section 1 is always Executive Summary
- Section 12 is always Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- No sections skipped (except Data Flow Patterns - see Optional Sections)

✅ **Section numbers are present with period**
- Format: `## [NUMBER]. [NAME]`
- Must have period after number: "## 1. " not "## 1 "

✅ **No custom section names unless documented as optional**
- Stick to the 12 standard names
- If adding subsections, those are fine (e.g., "### 2.1 Problem Statement")

✅ **Data Flow Patterns (Section 6) may be omitted for simple systems**
- If omitted, renumber subsequent sections (7→6, 8→7, etc.)
- Document Index must reflect 11-section structure

### Verification Command

Use this bash command to check section headers:

```bash
grep -n "^## [0-9]" ARCHITECTURE.md
```

**Expected Output** (12-section structure):
```
25:## 1. Executive Summary
54:## 2. System Overview
147:## 3. Architecture Principles
301:## 4. Architecture Layers
456:## 5. Component Details
676:## 6. Data Flow Patterns
851:## 7. Integration Points
998:## 8. Technology Stack
1244:## 9. Security Architecture
1417:## 10. Scalability & Performance
1623:## 11. Operational Considerations
1850:## 12. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
```

**Expected Output** (11-section structure, Data Flow omitted):
```
25:## 1. Executive Summary
54:## 2. System Overview
147:## 3. Architecture Principles
301:## 4. Architecture Layers
456:## 5. Component Details
676:## 6. Integration Points         ← Was 7, renumbered
851:## 7. Technology Stack          ← Was 8, renumbered
998:## 8. Security Architecture     ← Was 9, renumbered
1244:## 9. Scalability & Performance  ← Was 10, renumbered
1417:## 10. Operational Considerations ← Was 11, renumbered
1623:## 11. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) ← Was 12, renumbered
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Using abbreviated or alternative section names**

| Wrong ❌ | Correct ✅ |
|---------|-----------|
| "ADR References" | "Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)" |
| "Decision References (ADRs)" | "Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)" |
| "Tech Stack" | "Technology Stack" |
| "Security" | "Security Architecture" |
| "Performance" | "Scalability & Performance" |
| "Operations" | "Operational Considerations" |

❌ **Reordering sections**
- Example: Putting "Technology Stack" before "Integration Points"
- Fix: Follow standard order (1-12)

❌ **Omitting section numbers**
- Example: `## Executive Summary`
- Fix: `## 1. Executive Summary`

❌ **Using wrong number format**
- Example: `## 1 Executive Summary` (missing period)
- Fix: `## 1. Executive Summary`

❌ **Adding custom sections between standard sections**
- Example: Adding "## 13. Future Roadmap" or "## 6.5 Custom Section"
- Fix: Use subsections (###) for custom content within standard sections

❌ **Wrong capitalization**
- Example: `## 1. executive summary` (lowercase)
- Fix: `## 1. Executive Summary` (title case)

### Optional Sections

**Data Flow Patterns (Section 6)**:

**Include if:**
- ✅ System has complex data flows requiring visualization
- ✅ Multiple data transformation steps
- ✅ Event streaming or data pipelines
- ✅ Integration patterns need detailed explanation

**Omit for:**
- ❌ Simple request/response patterns
- ❌ Straightforward CRUD operations
- ❌ No complex data transformations

**If omitted:**
- Renumber subsequent sections:
  - Section 7 (Integration Points) → Section 6
  - Section 8 (Technology Stack) → Section 7
  - Section 9 (Security Architecture) → Section 8
  - Section 10 (Scalability & Performance) → Section 9
  - Section 11 (Operational Considerations) → Section 10
  - Section 12 (Architecture Decision Records) → Section 11
- **Update Document Index** to reflect 11-section structure
- **Note**: All section cross-references must be updated

### Section Renumbering Workflow

**When Data Flow Patterns is omitted:**

**Step 1**: Remove or comment out Section 6
```markdown
<!-- ## 6. Data Flow Patterns -->
<!-- (Omitted for this architecture - simple request/response patterns) -->
```

**Step 2**: Renumber subsequent sections
- Change `## 7. Integration Points` to `## 6. Integration Points`
- Change `## 8. Technology Stack` to `## 7. Technology Stack`
- Continue through Section 12 → Section 11

**Step 3**: Update Document Index
```markdown
## Document Index

**Quick Navigation:**
- [Section 1: Executive Summary](#1-executive-summary) → Lines 25-53
- [Section 2: System Overview](#2-system-overview) → Lines 54-146
- [Section 3: Architecture Principles](#3-architecture-principles) → Lines 147-300
- [Section 4: Architecture Layers](#4-architecture-layers) → Lines 301-455
- [Section 5: Component Details](#5-component-details) → Lines 456-675
- [Section 6: Integration Points](#6-integration-points) → Lines 676-850
  <!-- Note: Data Flow Patterns omitted, sections renumbered -->
- [Section 7: Technology Stack](#7-technology-stack) → Lines 851-997
- [Section 8: Security Architecture](#8-security-architecture) → Lines 998-1243
- [Section 9: Scalability & Performance](#9-scalability--performance) → Lines 1244-1416
- [Section 10: Operational Considerations](#10-operational-considerations) → Lines 1417-1622
- [Section 11: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](#11-architecture-decision-records-adrs) → Lines 1623-end

**Index Last Updated:** 2025-01-29
```

**Step 4**: Update all internal cross-references
- Search for references to sections 7-12
- Update to new numbers (6-11)

## 4. Architecture Type-Aware Validation

### Overview

Starting with the Architecture Type Selection feature, ARCHITECTURE.md documents are categorized into one of four architecture types:
- **META Architecture** (6-layer enterprise)
- **3-Tier Architecture** (classic web application)
- **Microservices Architecture** (cloud-native distributed)
- **N-Layer Architecture** (DDD, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal)

Each architecture type has **type-specific validation rules** for Section 4 (Meta Architecture) and Section 5 (Component Details).

### Detecting Architecture Type

**Method 1: Metadata Comment Detection**

Search for the architecture type metadata comment in Section 4:

```bash
grep -n "<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE:" ARCHITECTURE.md
```

**Valid metadata values:**
- `<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE: META -->`
- `<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE: 3-TIER -->`
- `<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE: MICROSERVICES -->`
- `<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE: N-LAYER -->`

**Method 2: Section 4 Header Inference**

If no metadata comment exists, infer type from Section 4 headers:

```bash
grep -n "^### [0-9]" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep -A5 "## 4\."
```

**Inference Rules:**

| Pattern Found in Section 4 | Inferred Type |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| "Layer 1: Channels" AND "Layer 5: Domain" | **META** |
| "Tier 1: Presentation" OR "Tier 3: Data" | **3-Tier** |
| "API Gateway" AND "Service Mesh" | **Microservices** |
| "Clean Architecture" OR "Hexagonal" OR "Ports & Adapters" | **N-Layer** |

### META Architecture Validation

**Applies when**: `<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE: META -->` is present OR Section 4 contains META layer headers.

#### Section 4: Meta Architecture Layers

✅ **All 6 layers must be documented:**
- Layer 1: Channels
- Layer 2: User Experience (UX)
- Layer 3: Business Scenarios
- Layer 4: Integration
- Layer 5: Domain
- Layer 6: Core

✅ **Layers appear in correct order (1-6)**

✅ **Section 4 should be named "Architecture Layers"**
- **Correct**: `## 4. Architecture Layers` or `## 4. Meta Architecture` (legacy)
- **Incorrect**: `## 4. Meta Architecture` (missing "Layers" suffix)

**Verification Command:**
```bash
grep -n "^### [0-9]\.[1-6]" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep -A2 "## 4\."
```

**Expected Output** (excerpt):
```
### 4.1 Layer 1: Channels
### 4.2 Layer 2: User Experience (UX)
### 4.3 Layer 3: Business Scenarios
### 4.4 Layer 4: Integration
### 4.5 Layer 5: Domain
### 4.6 Layer 6: Core
```

#### Section 5: Component Details

✅ **Components grouped by layer:**
- Each component MUST specify which layer it belongs to
- Use headers like: `## Layer 1: Channels - Components` or `### [Component Name] (Layer 5: Domain)`

✅ **Layer 5 (Domain) components MUST include BIAN V12.0 alignment (default version):**
- **BIAN Capability Name**: Official service domain name validated in [BIAN Service Landscape V12.0](https://bian.org/servicelandscape-12-0-0/views/view_51891.html)
- **BIAN ID**: Internal document tracking ID (e.g., SD-001, SD-002) - for counting service domains only
- **BIAN Alignment** subsection with official BIAN reference URLs
- Service Domain Model version must be documented as "BIAN V12.0" (default and recommended version)
- Must link to official BIAN V12.0 service domain definition
- **BIAN Alignment Details**:
  - Service Domain Model version (BIAN V12.0)
  - Behavior Qualifiers
  - Functional Patterns
  - Control Records description

**Example Layer 5 Component Structure:**
```markdown
### Customer Contact Management (Layer 5: Domain)

**Type**: Microservice | Service Domain
**BIAN ID**: SD-047

**BIAN Alignment**:
- Service Domain Model: [BIAN V12.0](https://bian.org/servicelandscape-12-0-0/views/view_51891.html) (default version)
- BIAN Capability Name: [Payment Execution] - validated in [official landscape](https://bian.org/servicelandscape-12-0-0/views/view_51891.html)
- BIAN ID: SD-047 - internal tracking ID only
- Official Definition: [BIAN Service Landscape V12.0](https://bian.org/servicelandscape-12-0-0/views/view_51891.html)
- Control Record: Customer Contact Record
- Service Operations: Initiate, Update, Retrieve
- Behavior Qualifiers: CustomerContact, ContactMechanism
```

**Validation Commands for BIAN Alignment:**
```bash
# Validate BIAN V12.0 alignment in Layer 5
grep -A20 "Layer 5: Domain" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep "BIAN V12.0"

# Verify BIAN landscape URL is referenced
grep -o "https://bian.org/servicelandscape-12-0-0" ARCHITECTURE.md
```

#### Common Errors - META

❌ **Missing layers from the required 6**
- Fix: Add all 6 layers in Section 4

❌ **Layers out of order**
- Fix: Reorder to 1→2→3→4→5→6

❌ **Layer 5 components missing BIAN alignment**
- Fix: Add BIAN ID and alignment details

❌ **Components not mapped to specific layers**
- Fix: Indicate layer for each component in Section 5

### 3-Tier Architecture Validation

**Applies when**: `<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE: 3-TIER -->` is present OR Section 4 contains tier headers.

#### Section 4: Meta Architecture

✅ **All 3 tiers must be documented:**
- Tier 1: Presentation
- Tier 2: Application/Business Logic
- Tier 3: Data

✅ **Tiers appear in correct order (1-3)**

✅ **Section 4 header should reflect 3-Tier pattern:**
- **Correct**: `## 4. Architecture Layers - 3-Tier Classic Web Application` or `## 4. Architecture Layers`
- **Incorrect**: `## 4. Meta Architecture` (missing "Layers" suffix)

**Verification Command:**
```bash
grep -n "^### [0-9]\.[1-3]" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep -A1 "## 4\."
```

**Expected Output** (excerpt):
```
### 4.1 Tier 1: Presentation
### 4.2 Tier 2: Application/Business Logic
### 4.3 Tier 3: Data
```

#### Section 5: Component Details

✅ **Components grouped by tier:**
- Use headers: `## Tier 1: Presentation Layer - Components`
- Each component indicates tier assignment

✅ **Tier separation enforced:**
- **No direct database access from Tier 1** (Presentation)
- Presentation tier components must NOT have direct database connections
- All data access goes through Tier 2 (Application) → Tier 3 (Data)

✅ **Tier 2 components are stateless:**
- Application/Business Logic components should be stateless for horizontal scalability
- Session state managed externally (e.g., Redis, database)

**Validation Check for Tier Separation:**

Search for forbidden patterns (Presentation tier with database):
```bash
grep -B5 -A10 "Tier 1" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep -i "database\|postgres\|mysql\|mongodb"
```

If matches found → **VIOLATION**: Presentation tier should NOT access database directly.

#### Common Errors - 3-Tier

❌ **Missing tiers from the required 3**
- Fix: Document all 3 tiers

❌ **Tier 1 components accessing database directly**
- Fix: Route data access through Tier 2 → Tier 3

❌ **Tier 2 components with stateful session management**
- Fix: Externalize session state (Redis, distributed cache)

❌ **Using "Layer" terminology instead of "Tier"**
- Fix: Use "Tier 1", "Tier 2", "Tier 3" for consistency

### Microservices Architecture Validation

**Applies when**: `<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE: MICROSERVICES -->` is present OR Section 4 contains microservices infrastructure components.

#### Section 4: Meta Architecture

✅ **Infrastructure components documented:**
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for clients
- **Service Mesh**: Service-to-service communication infrastructure (or justification if omitted)
- **Event Bus**: Asynchronous communication backbone (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)
- **Service Discovery**: How services find each other (or justification if not used)

✅ **Section 4 header reflects microservices pattern:**
- **Correct**: `## 4. Meta Architecture - Microservices Architecture` or `## 4. Meta Architecture`

**Verification Command:**
```bash
grep -i "API Gateway\|Service Mesh\|Event Bus\|Service Discovery" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep -A5 "## 4\."
```

✅ **If API Gateway or Service Mesh omitted:**
- Must include justification in Section 4 or ADR
- Example: "Service Mesh omitted - using direct service-to-service mTLS with client-side load balancing"

#### Section 5: Component Details

✅ **Database-per-service pattern followed:**
- Each microservice MUST have its own database (no shared databases)
- Each service documented with dedicated data store
- If shared database exists → **VIOLATION** (or must justify in ADR)

✅ **Each microservice includes:**
- **Bounded Context**: Domain/business capability it owns
- **API Specification**: REST/gRPC/GraphQL endpoints
- **Events Published**: Event names, triggers, payloads, consumers
- **Events Consumed**: Events from other services, actions taken
- **Circuit Breaker Configuration**: Failure threshold, timeout, fallback strategy

✅ **Event bus topics documented:**
- Event names follow naming convention (e.g., `service.resource.action`)
- Event schemas versioned (v1, v2, etc.)
- Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) handling documented

**Validation Check for Database-per-Service:**

```bash
# Count services
grep -c "### .* Service$" ARCHITECTURE.md

# Count databases (should match or exceed service count)
grep -c "Database\|PostgreSQL\|MongoDB\|DynamoDB" ARCHITECTURE.md
```

If services > databases → **WARNING**: Verify database-per-service pattern.

**Validation Check for Circuit Breakers:**

```bash
grep -i "circuit breaker\|resilience4j\|hystrix" ARCHITECTURE.md | wc -l
```

Should have matches for each synchronous inter-service dependency.

#### Common Errors - Microservices

❌ **Shared database across multiple services**
- Fix: Implement database-per-service or document exception in ADR

❌ **API Gateway or Service Mesh not documented (and no justification)**
- Fix: Add infrastructure component or explain omission

❌ **Event bus missing for event-driven services**
- Fix: Document event bus (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)

❌ **No circuit breakers for synchronous calls**
- Fix: Configure circuit breakers for all sync dependencies

❌ **Events not versioned**
- Fix: Add schema versioning (v1, v2) to event definitions

### N-Layer Architecture Validation

**Applies when**: `<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE: N-LAYER -->` is present OR Section 4 contains N-Layer pattern headers.

#### Section 4: Meta Architecture

✅ **Pattern specification required:**
- Must specify which N-Layer pattern is used:
  - **4-Layer Classic DDD**
  - **5-Layer Extended**
  - **Clean Architecture**
  - **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**
  - **Custom N-Layer** (with layer definitions)

✅ **Dependency direction documented:**
- Clear dependency rules between layers
- Example: "Presentation → Application → Domain; Infrastructure → Domain (implements interfaces)"

✅ **Layer boundaries defined:**
- Each layer has defined components
- Communication patterns between layers documented
- Interfaces at layer boundaries documented

**Verification Command:**
```bash
grep -i "4-Layer\|5-Layer\|Clean Architecture\|Hexagonal\|Ports & Adapters" ARCHITECTURE.md | head -5
```

Should find pattern specification in Section 4.

#### Section 5: Component Details

✅ **Components organized by layer:**
- Each component assigned to a specific layer
- Layer headers used: `## Layer 1: Presentation`, `## Core: Entities`, etc.

✅ **Core/Domain layer is framework-free (if applicable):**
- For DDD, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal patterns:
  - Domain/Core layer should have NO framework dependencies
  - Pure business logic only
  - No references to ORM, web framework, external libraries

✅ **Infrastructure layer implements domain interfaces (if applicable):**
- Repository implementations in Infrastructure layer
- External service adapters in Infrastructure layer
- Infrastructure depends on Domain (not vice versa)

**Validation Check for Framework-Free Domain:**

For DDD/Clean/Hexagonal patterns:
```bash
# Check Domain/Core layer for framework imports
grep -A30 "Domain\|Core" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep -i "spring\|express\|django\|sequelize\|typeorm"
```

If matches found → **WARNING**: Domain layer should be framework-free.

#### Common Errors - N-Layer

❌ **Pattern not specified**
- Fix: Declare which N-Layer pattern (DDD, Clean, Hexagonal, etc.)

❌ **Dependency direction not documented**
- Fix: Add dependency rules (e.g., "Dependencies point INWARD")

❌ **Domain layer with framework dependencies**
- Fix: Remove framework dependencies from domain/core layer

❌ **Infrastructure layer depends on external frameworks (not domain interfaces)**
- Fix: Infrastructure should implement domain-defined interfaces

❌ **Circular dependencies between layers**
- Fix: Enforce unidirectional dependencies with dependency inversion

### Type-Aware Validation Workflow

**Step 1: Detect Architecture Type**

```bash
# Check for metadata comment
grep "<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE:" ARCHITECTURE.md
```

If found → Use specified type
If not found → Infer from Section 4 headers (see inference rules above)

**Step 2: Apply Type-Specific Validation**

Based on detected type, run appropriate validation:

**META**:
```bash
# Check all 6 layers present
grep -n "^### [0-9]\.[1-6]" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep "Layer"

# Check BIAN alignment in Layer 5 components
grep -A20 "Layer 5: Domain" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep "BIAN"
```

**3-Tier**:
```bash
# Check all 3 tiers present
grep -n "^### [0-9]\.[1-3]" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep "Tier"

# Check no direct DB access from Tier 1
grep -B5 -A10 "Tier 1" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep -i "database"
```

**Microservices**:
```bash
# Check infrastructure components
grep -i "API Gateway\|Service Mesh\|Event Bus" ARCHITECTURE.md

# Check database-per-service pattern
grep -c "### .* Service$" ARCHITECTURE.md
grep -c "Database" ARCHITECTURE.md
```

**N-Layer**:
```bash
# Check pattern specified
grep -i "4-Layer\|5-Layer\|Clean\|Hexagonal" ARCHITECTURE.md

# Check dependency direction documented
grep -i "dependency\|depends on" ARCHITECTURE.md
```

**Step 3: Report Validation Results**

Create validation report:

```markdown
## Architecture Type Validation Report

**Detected Type**: [META | 3-Tier | Microservices | N-Layer]

**Validation Results**:

✅ **Passed Checks**:
- [List passed validations]

❌ **Failed Checks**:
- [List violations with line numbers]

⚠️ **Warnings**:
- [List warnings or missing best practices]

**Recommendations**:
- [Fix suggestions for failed checks]
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Validate structure during document creation
- ✅ Run verification commands (grep) to check sections
- ✅ Use validation checklist before finalizing
- ✅ Update Document Index after structural changes
- ✅ Enforce strict section names and order
- ✅ Ensure all 9 principles are documented
- ✅ Include system-specific implementation details
- ✅ Document honest trade-offs for each principle

### DON'T:
- ❌ Skip required sections
- ❌ Use abbreviated section names
- ❌ Reorder sections from standard sequence
- ❌ Omit principle subsections (Description/Implementation/Trade-offs)
- ❌ Use generic placeholder text
- ❌ Include Event-Driven principle unless system uses it
- ❌ Add custom principles beyond standard 9-10
- ❌ Forget to update Document Index after changes

## Integration with Workflows

**When to Apply Validations**:

1. **During document creation**: Validate structure as you build
2. **Before architecture reviews**: Run full validation checklist
3. **After major updates**: Verify section integrity
4. **Quarterly reviews**: Ensure document still meets standards

**Validation Workflow**:

```
1. Run section header check:
   grep -n "^## [0-9]" ARCHITECTURE.md

2. Verify all 12 sections present and in order

3. Check Section 3 has all 9 required principles:
   grep -n "^### 3\.[1-9]" ARCHITECTURE.md

4. Validate each principle has required subsections:
   - Description
   - Implementation
   - Trade-offs

5. Run completeness checklist

6. Update Document Index if needed

7. Report validation results to user
```
