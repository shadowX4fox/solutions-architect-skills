# Query-to-Section Mapping Guide

This guide maps common architectural questions to ARCHITECTURE.md sections for the Informational Query Workflow (Workflow 7).

## Purpose

When users ask questions about the architecture, this guide helps identify which ARCHITECTURE.md section(s) contain the answer, enabling context-efficient loading and accurate citations.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Classify the user's question** by identifying the main topic (authentication, scaling, components, etc.)
2. **Consult the relevant section mapping** below to find which ARCHITECTURE.md section contains the answer
3. **Load the identified section(s)** using the index-based approach from Workflow 7
4. **Extract the answer** and provide citations with line numbers

## Multi-Section Query Scenarios

Some questions require information from **multiple sections**. Here are common multi-section scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Security + Integrations

**Question**: "How does authentication work with external systems?"

**Sections to load**:
- Section 9 (Security Architecture → Authentication)
- Section 7 (Integration Points → External Systems)

**Answer should synthesize**:
- Authentication mechanism from Section 9
- How external integrations use that authentication from Section 7

---

### Scenario 2: Technology Stack + Deployment

**Question**: "What's the backend tech stack and how is it deployed?"

**Sections to load**:
- Section 8 (Technology Stack → Backend)
- Section 4 (Architecture Layers → Cloud Infrastructure)

**Answer should synthesize**:
- Technologies used from Section 8
- Deployment environment and approach from Section 4

---

### Scenario 3: Components + Data Flow

**Question**: "How does the [Component X] process data?"

**Sections to load**:
- Section 5 (Component Details → Component X)
- Section 6 (Data Flow Patterns)

**Answer should synthesize**:
- Component responsibilities from Section 5
- Data processing flow from Section 6

---

### Scenario 4: Performance + Scalability + Operations

**Question**: "How do you ensure the system meets performance SLAs?"

**Sections to load**:
- Section 10 (Scalability & Performance → SLAs)
- Section 11 (Operational Considerations → Monitoring)
- Section 3 (Architecture Principles → High Availability)

**Answer should synthesize**:
- Performance targets from Section 10
- Monitoring approach from Section 11
- Architectural principles supporting SLAs from Section 3

---

## Edge Cases and Ambiguous Queries

### Edge Case 1: Generic "How does it work?" Questions

**Question**: "How does the system work?"

**Strategy**: Too broad - load Section 1 (Executive Summary) for high-level overview, then ask clarifying questions.

**Response template**:
```
[Provide high-level summary from Section 1]

Would you like me to dive deeper into:
- Specific components (Section 5)?
- Data flows (Section 6)?
- Technology stack (Section 8)?
- Security architecture (Section 9)?
```

---

### Edge Case 2: Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Question**: "How do you handle errors?"

**Multiple possible sections**:
- Section 3 (Architecture Principles → Resilience)
- Section 6 (Data Flow Patterns → Error handling flows)
- Section 11 (Operational Considerations → Monitoring & Alerting)

**Strategy**: Load all relevant sections, synthesize a comprehensive answer covering principles, implementation, and operations.

---

### Edge Case 3: Versioning and Change History

**Question**: "What changed in the last update?"

**Strategy**: ARCHITECTURE.md typically doesn't track change history. Suggest:
- Check version control system (git log)
- Review Section 12 (ADRs) for recent decisions
- Check "Index Last Updated" date in Document Index

---

### Edge Case 4: Future Plans and Roadmap

**Question**: "What's planned for the future?"

**Strategy**: ARCHITECTURE.md documents **current state**, not future plans.

**Response template**:
```
ARCHITECTURE.md documents the current architecture. Future plans are typically maintained in:
- Product roadmap documents
- Architecture Decision Records (Section 12) with status "Proposed"
- Separate planning documents

Would you like me to help document a proposed architectural change in Section 12 as an ADR?
```

## Best Practices for Query-to-Section Mapping

**DO:**
- ✅ Start with the most specific section first
- ✅ Load additional sections if the first doesn't fully answer the question
- ✅ Consider cross-section queries for complex questions
- ✅ Check Document Index for actual section line ranges (don't assume)
- ✅ Use minimal buffers (±10-20 lines) for efficiency
- ✅ Synthesize multi-section answers clearly

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Load all sections for broad questions (start with Section 1, then drill down)
- ❌ Assume section line ranges without checking Document Index
- ❌ Mix documented content with assumptions
- ❌ Skip citations when answering from ARCHITECTURE.md
- ❌ Load full document when 1-2 sections suffice

## Example Query Mapping Workflow

**User Question**: "What authentication method do we use and how is it deployed?"

**Step 1: Classify Query**
- Primary topic: Authentication → Section 9
- Secondary topic: Deployment → Section 4

**Step 2: Load Document Index**
```
Read(file_path="ARCHITECTURE.md", offset=1, limit=50)
```

**Result**:
- Section 9: Lines 1301-1550
- Section 4: Lines 401-600

**Step 3: Load Section 9 (Primary)**
```
buffer = 20
offset = 1301 - 20 - 1 = 1280
limit = (1550 - 1301) + 40 = 249 + 40 = 289
Read(file_path="ARCHITECTURE.md", offset=1280, limit=289)
```

**Step 4: Search for Authentication Details**
- Found: OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, MFA (lines 1343-1367)

**Step 5: Load Section 4 (Secondary)**
```
offset = 401 - 20 - 1 = 380
limit = (600 - 401) + 40 = 199 + 40 = 239
Read(file_path="ARCHITECTURE.md", offset=380, limit=239)
```

**Step 6: Search for Deployment Details**
- Found: AWS deployment, ECS containers (lines 450-475)

**Step 7: Synthesize Answer with Citations**
```
The system uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication with JWT tokens for API access.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for administrative users.

The authentication service is deployed as a containerized microservice on AWS ECS
with auto-scaling enabled for high availability.

**Sources**:
- ARCHITECTURE.md Section 9 (Security Architecture → Authentication), lines 1343-1367
- ARCHITECTURE.md Section 4 (Architecture Layers → Cloud Deployment), lines 450-475
```
