# Architecture Review & Audit Workflow

## Overview

This document defines the two-phase review and audit workflow for ARCHITECTURE.md documents.

**Purpose**: Ensure structural integrity (Phase 1) before content improvement (Phase 2)

**Trigger**: Manual only - activated when user requests "review", "audit", or "validate"

**Key Principle**: Phase 1 must pass (no ❌ failed checks) before Phase 2 runs

---

## Phase 1: Form Validation (Blocking)

### Purpose

Verify structural integrity and compliance with architecture documentation standards. This phase ensures the document has the correct structure, required sections, and follows formatting standards before examining content quality.

### Validation Categories

#### 1. Section Structure Compliance

**What to Check**:
- All 12 required sections present and correctly ordered
- Section numbering consistent (1-12)
- Section names match standard naming exactly (case-sensitive)
- Document Index present with accurate line range references

**Standard Section Names**:
1. Executive Summary
2. System Overview
3. Architecture Principles
4. Architecture Layers (formerly "Meta Architecture")
5. Component Details
6. Data Flow Patterns
7. Integration Points
8. Technology Stack
9. Security Architecture
10. Scalability & Performance
11. Operational Considerations
12. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Common Violations**:
- ❌ Section missing entirely
- ❌ Section misspelled or wrong case (e.g., "system overview" vs "System Overview")
- ❌ Sections in wrong order
- ❌ Section numbering skipped or duplicated

---

#### 2. Architecture Type Validation

**What to Check**:
- HTML comment with architecture type present at top of document: `<!-- ARCHITECTURE_TYPE: {TYPE} -->`
- Architecture type is one of: META, 3-TIER, MICROSERVICES, N-LAYER
- Section 4 (Architecture Layers) structure matches declared architecture type
- Section 5 (Component Details) component organization matches architecture type

**Architecture Type Requirements**:

**META Architecture (6-Layer)**:
- Section 4 must define 6 layers: Channels → UX → Business Scenarios → Integration → Domain → Core
- Section 5 components must be mapped to these 6 layers

**3-Tier Architecture**:
- Section 4 must define 3 tiers: Presentation → Application/Business Logic → Data
- Section 5 components must be organized by tier assignment

**Microservices Architecture**:
- Section 4 must define service mesh topology and communication patterns
- Section 5 must provide service catalog with bounded contexts and APIs

**N-Layer Architecture**:
- Section 4 must define custom layers (4-7 layers typical)
- Section 5 components must be mapped to defined layers

**Common Violations**:
- ❌ Missing architecture type HTML comment
- ❌ Invalid architecture type value
- ❌ Section 4 structure doesn't match declared type
- ❌ Section 5 components not organized according to architecture type

---

#### 3. Architecture Principles Enforcement

**What to Check**:
- All 9 core principles documented in Section 3
- Each principle has three required subsections:
  1. **Description**: What the principle is and why it matters
  2. **Implementation**: How it's implemented in this specific system
  3. **Trade-offs**: Real costs and downsides (minimum 3 trade-offs per principle)
- Trade-offs are honest and substantive (not superficial or generic)

**9 Core Principles**:
1. Separation of Concerns
2. High Availability
3. Scalability First
4. Security by Design
5. Observability
6. Resilience
7. Simplicity
8. Cloud-Native (or equivalent deployment model)
9. Open Standards

**Trade-off Quality Criteria**:
- ✅ **Good**: "3x infrastructure costs for redundancy, 10-minute manual database failover RTO, requires 24/7 on-call rotation"
- ❌ **Bad**: "More complexity", "Higher costs", "Increased operational burden" (too vague)

**Common Violations**:
- ❌ Missing one or more core principles
- ❌ Principle lacks Description, Implementation, or Trade-offs subsection
- ❌ Fewer than 3 trade-offs listed
- ❌ Trade-offs are superficial or generic

---

#### 4. Markdown Formatting

**What to Check**:
- Valid markdown syntax throughout document
- Consistent heading levels (no skipped levels: H1 → H2 → H3, never H1 → H3)
- Code blocks properly formatted with language tags (```bash, ```typescript, etc.)
- Tables properly formatted with header rows and alignment
- Lists use consistent bullet style (-, *, or +)

**Common Violations**:
- ❌ Broken markdown links: `[text](url)` format incorrect
- ❌ Code blocks missing language tags: ` ``` ` instead of ` ```bash `
- ❌ Tables with misaligned columns or missing separators
- ❌ Heading level skipped (e.g., H2 → H4 without H3)

---

#### 5. Metric Consistency

**What to Check**:
- Section 1 (Executive Summary) defines key metrics
- Same metric values appear consistently throughout document
- Metrics to verify:
  - Read TPS (average and peak)
  - Write TPS (average and peak)
  - Latency (p95, p99)
  - Availability SLA (% uptime)
  - Concurrent users

**Common Violations**:
- ❌ Section 1 shows "500 Read TPS" but Section 9 shows "450 Read TPS"
- ❌ Latency targets defined in Section 1 but different values in Section 9
- ❌ Metrics missing from Section 1 entirely

---

### Phase 1 Output Format

```markdown
## Phase 1: Form Validation

### Status: ❌ FAILED

### Failed Checks:
- ❌ Section 4 name: Found "Meta Architecture", expected "Architecture Layers"
- ❌ Missing Architecture Principle: "Resilience" (Section 3)
- ❌ Inconsistent Read TPS: Section 1 shows 500 TPS, Section 9 shows 450 TPS
- ❌ Architecture Type HTML comment missing at document top

### Warnings:
- ⚠️ Document Index line ranges may be outdated (last update: 3 months ago)
- ⚠️ Section 3.2 trade-offs include vague statement "More complexity"

### Action Required:
Fix all ❌ Failed Checks before proceeding to Phase 2 (Content Improvement)

**Phase 2 will NOT run until all failed checks are resolved.**
```

**OR** (if all checks pass):

```markdown
## Phase 1: Form Validation

### Status: ✅ PASSED

All structural validation checks passed. Proceeding to Phase 2: Content Improvement.

### Warnings:
- ⚠️ Document Index line ranges may be outdated (last update: 3 months ago)
```

---

### Blocking Behavior

**CRITICAL**: If Phase 1 has ANY failed checks (❌), Phase 2 DOES NOT run.

User must:
1. Fix all ❌ failed checks
2. Re-request review/audit
3. Phase 1 will run again

Only when Phase 1 shows **Status: ✅ PASSED** does Phase 2 execute.

---

## Phase 2: Content Improvement (Prioritized)

### Purpose

Suggest content improvements based on criticality level, progressing from most critical (HIGH) to least critical (LOW). This phase analyzes content quality, completeness, and clarity.

### Trigger

**Runs ONLY if Phase 1 passes with no failed checks (❌)**

### Criticality Levels

Phase 2 issues are categorized into three levels based on impact to the document's usability and reliability:

- **HIGH**: Blocks publication/production use (must fix before document can be used)
- **MEDIUM**: Reduces clarity/usability (should fix to improve understanding)
- **LOW**: Polish/enhancement (optional improvements)

---

## Phase 2: Standards Compliance Framework

### How Phase 2 Recommendations Reference Standards

Every Phase 2 recommendation in this workflow explicitly references the architecture-docs skill standards to ensure all proposed changes are grounded in documented best practices.

**Enhanced Recommendation Structure**:

1. **Issue Title** with location in user's document
2. **What It Is**: Problem description and category
3. **Standard Violated**: Guide document, section, and line numbers
4. **Standard Requirement**: Direct quote from ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md
5. **Guide Example**: Reference to example showing proper implementation
6. **Current State**: What the user's document shows now
7. **Recommended Fix**: How to comply with the standard (references guide template)
8. **Compliance Checklist**: Items to verify that fix matches template requirements
9. **Location**: Specific lines in user's document

**Why This Matters**:
- **Traceability**: Users can look up the exact standard being enforced
- **Authority**: Recommendations backed by official guide, not arbitrary opinions
- **Learning**: Users learn architecture-docs skill standards while fixing issues
- **Consistency**: All reviews follow the same standards framework

---

## HIGH Criticality (Blocks Publication/Production Use)

### Definition

Issues that render the architecture document **unreliable, misleading, or unusable** for its intended purpose:
- Guiding implementation decisions
- Enabling engineer onboarding
- Supporting architectural reviews
- Documenting system behavior for operations/SRE

HIGH criticality issues prevent the document from serving as a trustworthy reference.

---

### HIGH.1: Missing Implementation Details

**What It Is**:
Critical components lack technical specifications necessary for implementation, deployment, or operations.

**Standard Violated**: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, Section 5 (lines 1007-1050)

**Standard Requirement**:
> Component Template requires: **Type**, **Technology**, **Version**, **Location**, **Purpose**, **Responsibilities**, **APIs/Interfaces**, **Dependencies**, **Configuration**, **Scaling**, **Failure Modes**, **Monitoring**

**Guide Example**: See ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, lines 1052-1101 for complete OrderService component example showing all required fields

**Examples of Missing Details**:
- Component has no technology stack specified (language, framework, runtime)
- No scaling strategy defined for components handling high load
- Missing configuration parameters required for deployment
- No failure mode analysis for critical components
- Missing API specification (endpoints, methods, request/response formats)

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
### HIGH Criticality (Must Fix Before Publication)

1. **Missing Implementation Details - OrderService** (Section 5.2)
   - Issue: No failure mode analysis provided
   - Standard Violated: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, §5, lines 1007-1050 (Component Template)
   - Standard Requirement: Component Template requires **Failure Modes** field documenting what happens when dependencies fail
   - Guide Example: Lines 1052-1101 show OrderService with complete failure mode analysis
   - Current: OrderService documented but **Failure Modes** subsection missing
   - Impact: Engineers cannot design error handling, retry logic, or monitoring alerts
   - Recommendation: Follow Component Template by adding **Failure Modes** subsection:
     - InventoryService unavailable: Circuit breaker pattern, return 503 Service Unavailable
     - PaymentService timeout (>10s): Retry 3 times with exponential backoff, mark order as pending
     - Database connection failure: Connection pool exhaustion, queue requests, timeout after 5s
   - Compliance Checklist:
     - [ ] Includes **Failure Modes** subsection heading (bold)
     - [ ] Documents behavior for each critical dependency failure
     - [ ] Specifies mitigation strategies (circuit breaker, retry, fallback)
     - [ ] Follows guide example structure
   - Location: Section 5.2, lines 293-341
```

---

### HIGH.2: Dishonest or Superficial Trade-offs

**What It Is**:
Architecture Principles (Section 3) list trade-offs that are vague, generic, or only mention positive aspects without real downsides.

**Standard Violated**: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, Section 3 (lines 467-649)

**Standard Requirement**:
> - "Each principle requires 3 subsections: **Description**, **Implementation**, **Trade-offs**" (lines 487-507)
> - "Trade-offs must be **honest and substantive** (not superficial or generic)" (lines 641-648)
> - "Minimum 3 trade-offs per principle"

**Guide Example**: See ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, lines 280-286 for examples of good vs. bad trade-offs

**Characteristics of Superficial Trade-offs**:
- Generic statements: "More complexity", "Higher costs", "Additional overhead"
- No quantification of impact
- No specifics about what makes it complex, costly, or burdensome
- Only mentions benefits, omits real downsides

**Good vs. Bad Trade-offs**:

**❌ Superficial**:
> "Increased operational complexity managing multiple instances"

**✅ Honest and Specific**:
> "Requires 24/7 on-call rotation (2 engineers minimum), 3x infrastructure costs ($15K/month vs $5K/month for single instance), 10-minute manual failover RTO for database primary, quarterly disaster recovery drills (8 hours per drill)"

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
2. **Dishonest Trade-off - High Availability Principle** (Section 3.2)
   - Issue: Trade-off is vague and non-quantified
   - Standard Violated: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, §3, lines 641-648
   - Standard Requirement: "Trade-offs must be honest and substantive (not superficial or generic)"
   - Guide Example: Lines 280-286 show good trade-offs with specific quantification
   - Current: "Increased operational complexity managing multiple instances"
   - Impact: Cannot assess true operational burden, staffing requirements, or cost implications
   - Recommendation: Follow guide example by quantifying specific costs:
     - On-call requirements: "24/7 rotation, minimum 2 engineers"
     - Infrastructure costs: "$15K/month (3x vs single instance $5K/month)"
     - Failover time: "10-minute manual database failover RTO (not automated)"
     - Operational tasks: "Quarterly disaster recovery drills (8 hours per drill)"
   - Compliance Checklist:
     - [ ] Includes specific staffing numbers (not "more people")
     - [ ] Includes cost quantification with dollar amounts (not "higher costs")
     - [ ] Includes time-based metrics (RTO, drill duration)
     - [ ] Follows guide example structure for honest trade-offs
   - Location: Section 3.2, lines 110-115
```

---

### HIGH.3: Inconsistent or Missing Metrics

**What It Is**:
Key performance metrics are either missing from Executive Summary or inconsistent beyond what Phase 1 catches.

**Standard Violated**: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, Section 1 (lines 213-243) and Section 10 (lines 1351-1368)

**Standard Requirement**:
> - Executive Summary must specify: **Read TPS**, **Processing TPS**, **Write TPS**, **Availability SLA**, **Latency Targets** (p95, p99)
> - Include "**Measurement Period**" context (e.g., "measured over last 30 days")
> - Metrics must be consistent between Section 1 and Section 10

**Guide Example**: See ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, lines 213-243 for proper metrics documentation format

**Examples**:
- No Read TPS specified in Section 1 (cannot assess scalability requirements)
- Latency targets undefined (p95, p99 not documented)
- Availability SLA not specified (cannot design for reliability)
- Component-level metrics missing (e.g., database IOPS, API rate limits)

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
3. **Missing Metrics - Executive Summary** (Section 1)
   - Issue: No Read TPS or Write TPS specified in Section 1
   - Standard Violated: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, §1, lines 213-243
   - Standard Requirement: Executive Summary must include Read TPS, Write TPS with measurement period context
   - Guide Example: Lines 213-243 show format: "Read TPS: 500 TPS (average), 1,200 TPS (peak) - measured over last 30 days"
   - Current: Section 1 Key Metrics subsection missing TPS metrics entirely
   - Impact: Cannot assess whether architecture supports expected load, cannot design scaling strategy
   - Recommendation: Follow guide format by adding:
     - "Read TPS: 500 TPS (average), 1,200 TPS (peak) - measured over last 30 days"
     - "Write TPS: 50 TPS (average), 150 TPS (peak) - measured over last 30 days"
   - Compliance Checklist:
     - [ ] Includes Read TPS (average and peak)
     - [ ] Includes Write TPS (average and peak)
     - [ ] Includes measurement period context ("measured over last X days")
     - [ ] Matches values in Section 10 (Scalability & Performance)
   - Location: Section 1, lines 34-40
```

---

### HIGH.4: Incomplete Component Documentation

**What It Is**:
Critical components in Section 5 (Component Details) are missing essential information required for implementation or operations.

**Standard Violated**: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, Section 5 (lines 1007-1050)

**Standard Requirement**:
> Component Template requires: **Type**, **Technology**, **Version**, **Location**, **Purpose**, **Responsibilities**, **APIs/Interfaces**, **Dependencies**, **Configuration**, **Scaling**, **Failure Modes**, **Monitoring**
> (Same as HIGH.1 - uses Component Template standard)

**Guide Example**: See ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, lines 1052-1101 for complete OrderService component example

**Required Component Information**:
- **Purpose**: What the component does and why it exists
- **Responsibilities**: Specific tasks and business logic
- **Dependencies**: What it depends on and what depends on it
- **Technology**: Language, framework, runtime, libraries
- **Configuration**: Required environment variables, config files
- **Scaling**: How it scales (horizontal/vertical), resource requirements
- **Failure Modes**: What happens when dependencies fail, how it degrades
- **Monitoring**: Key metrics, alerts, SLOs

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
4. **Incomplete Component Documentation - PaymentService** (Section 5.4)
   - Issue: Missing **Failure Modes** and **Monitoring** subsections
   - Standard Violated: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, §5, lines 1007-1050 (Component Template)
   - Standard Requirement: Component Template requires **Failure Modes** (dependency failures, mitigation) and **Monitoring** (metrics, alerts, SLOs)
   - Guide Example: Lines 1052-1101 show OrderService with complete failure modes and monitoring
   - Current: PaymentService documented but missing critical operational details
   - Impact: Engineers cannot implement resilient payment processing, no monitoring strategy, risk payment failures without recovery
   - Recommendation: Follow Component Template by adding:
     - **Failure Modes**: Stripe API errors (card declined, insufficient funds, network timeout), retry logic (3 retries, exponential backoff 1s/2s/4s), circuit breaker (open after 50% error rate), compensation logic
     - **Monitoring**: Key metrics (payment success rate, processing time p95/p99), alerts (error rate >2%, processing time >5s), SLO (99.9% success rate)
   - Compliance Checklist:
     - [ ] Includes **Failure Modes** subsection with dependency failures
     - [ ] Includes **Monitoring** subsection with metrics and alerts
     - [ ] Specifies mitigation strategies (retry, circuit breaker)
     - [ ] Follows guide example structure
   - Location: Section 5.4, lines 380-420
```

---

### HIGH.5: Critical Integration Missing Details

**What It Is**:
External integrations (Section 7) lack essential details for secure, reliable communication.

**Standard Violated**: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, Section 7 (lines 1133-1179)

**Standard Requirement**:
> Integration documentation requires: **Type**, **Provider**, **Purpose**, **Protocol & Authentication**, **Rate Limits & SLA**, **Error Handling**, **Data Exchanged**, **Failure Behavior**, **Monitoring & Health Checks**, **Security**, **Cost**

**Guide Example**: See ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, lines 1180-1230 for complete Stripe integration example

**Required Integration Information**:
- **Authentication**: How system authenticates (API keys, OAuth, JWT)
- **Error Handling**: Timeout values, retry logic, circuit breaker
- **SLA**: Expected uptime, response time from external service
- **Rate Limiting**: Request limits, backoff strategy
- **Data Format**: Request/response schemas, content types
- **Failure Behavior**: What happens when integration is unavailable

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
5. **Critical Integration Missing Details - Stripe Payment Gateway** (Section 7.1)
   - Issue: Missing **Error Handling** and **Rate Limits & SLA** fields
   - Standard Violated: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, §7, lines 1133-1179 (Integration Template)
   - Standard Requirement: Integration Template requires **Error Handling** (timeout, retry, circuit breaker) and **Rate Limits & SLA** (request limits, uptime guarantees)
   - Guide Example: Lines 1180-1230 show Stripe integration with complete error handling and rate limits
   - Current: Stripe integration documented but missing resilience and performance details
   - Impact: Payment processing can hang indefinitely, no resilience if Stripe experiences degraded performance, risk exceeding rate limits
   - Recommendation: Follow Integration Template by adding:
     - **Error Handling**: Timeout (10s per request), retry logic (3 retries, exponential backoff 1s/2s/4s), circuit breaker (open after 50% error rate over 10 requests, 30s timeout before retry)
     - **Rate Limits & SLA**: Max 100 requests/second (Stripe limit), 99.99% uptime SLA, <500ms response time (p95)
   - Compliance Checklist:
     - [ ] Includes **Error Handling** with timeout, retry, circuit breaker
     - [ ] Includes **Rate Limits & SLA** with request limits and uptime guarantees
     - [ ] Specifies backoff strategy for rate limiting
     - [ ] Follows guide example structure
   - Location: Section 7.1, lines 412-432
```

## MEDIUM Criticality (Reduces Clarity/Usability)

### Definition

Issues that **reduce document clarity**, make onboarding harder, or create confusion, but **do not block implementation**. Engineers can still build the system, but understanding will be more difficult.

---

### MEDIUM.1: Weak Justifications

**What It Is**:
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) or technology choices lack clear rationale or don't explain why alternatives were rejected.

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
### MEDIUM Criticality (Improves Clarity)

1. **Weak Justification - ADR-001** (Section 12)
   - Issue: Microservices alternative rejected but rationale incomplete
   - Current: "Rejected due to team size and operational complexity"
   - Impact: Future readers may question decision without full context, decision may be revisited unnecessarily
   - Recommendation: Add specific constraints that drove decision:
     - "Team of 3 developers (no dedicated DevOps engineer)"
     - "Infrastructure budget: <$10K/month (microservices requires API gateway, service mesh, multiple databases)"
     - "Estimated 6-month delay for microservices setup vs 2-month 3-tier implementation"
   - Location: Section 12, ADR-001, lines 458-461
```

---

### MEDIUM.2: Outdated References

**What It Is**:
Technology versions, documentation links, or tool references are outdated or point to deprecated resources.

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
2. **Outdated Reference - Technology Stack** (Section 8)
   - Issue: References Node.js 14 (reached End-of-Life April 30, 2023)
   - Current: "Node.js 14, Express.js 4"
   - Impact: Misleading for new engineers, Node.js 14 has security vulnerabilities
   - Recommendation: Update to current LTS version: "Node.js 20 LTS, Express.js 4"
   - Location: Section 8, line 612
```

---

### MEDIUM.3: Inconsistent Formatting

**What It Is**:
Component documentation structure, emphasis styles, or table formatting varies across sections, reducing readability.

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
3. **Inconsistent Formatting - Component Documentation** (Section 5)
   - Issue: Section 5.1 uses '**Type**:' (bold), Section 5.2 uses 'Type:' (no bold)
   - Impact: Reduces visual consistency, harder to scan for specific fields
   - Recommendation: Standardize all component subsection headers to bold:
     - **Type**, **Technology**, **Location**, **Purpose**, etc.
   - Locations: Section 5.1 (line 244), Section 5.2 (line 294), Section 5.3 (line 346)
```

---

### MEDIUM.4: Missing Cross-References

**What It Is**:
Document references other components, sections, or ADRs without providing navigation links or section numbers.

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
4. **Missing Cross-Reference - OrderService Dependencies** (Section 5.2)
   - Issue: References PaymentService without cross-reference link
   - Current: "Order processing coordination (via PaymentService)"
   - Impact: Readers must manually search for PaymentService documentation
   - Recommendation: Add section reference: "Order processing coordination (via PaymentService, Section 5.4)"
   - Location: Section 5.2, line 305
```

---

### MEDIUM.5: Ambiguous Terminology

**What It Is**:
Technical terms, acronyms, or domain-specific language used without definition or context.

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
5. **Ambiguous Terminology - Circuit Breaker Pattern** (Section 5.2)
   - Issue: "Circuit breaker pattern" mentioned without explanation
   - Impact: Engineers unfamiliar with pattern may not understand implementation
   - Recommendation: Add brief explanation or link:
     - "Circuit breaker pattern (prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to failing service)"
     - OR: "Circuit breaker pattern (see Section 3.6 Resilience for details)"
   - Location: Section 5.2, line 334
```

---

## LOW Criticality (Polish/Enhancement)

### Definition

Minor improvements that **enhance document quality** but **do not affect understanding or implementation**. These are optional refinements.

---

### LOW.1: Formatting Suggestions

**What It Is**:
Cosmetic formatting improvements for visual consistency.

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
### LOW Criticality (Optional Polish)

1. **Formatting Suggestion - Section Headers**
   - Observation: Inconsistent blank lines before H2 headers (some have 2, some have 1)
   - Recommendation: Standardize to 2 blank lines before all H2 headers for visual separation
   - Impact: Improves readability, no functional change
   - Location: Throughout document
```

---

### LOW.2: Clarity Improvements

**What It Is**:
Sentence restructuring or simplification for easier reading.

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
2. **Clarity Improvement - Passive Voice** (Section 2.1)
   - Observation: "The system is designed to handle high-throughput order processing"
   - Recommendation: Use active voice: "The system handles high-throughput order processing"
   - Impact: More direct and concise
   - Location: Section 2.1, line 56
```

---

### LOW.3: Additional Context

**What It Is**:
Optional background information, historical context, or links to related documentation.

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
3. **Additional Context - API Design** (Section 6)
   - Observation: Integration Points section could reference team's API design guide
   - Recommendation: Add reference: "All integrations follow team API design standards (see: /docs/api-design-guide.md)"
   - Impact: Provides additional context for API patterns
   - Location: Section 6, header (after line 410)
```

---

### LOW.4: Redundancy Reduction

**What It Is**:
Duplicate information across sections that could be consolidated for easier maintenance.

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
4. **Redundancy Reduction - Database Configuration** (Sections 5.3 and 8)
   - Observation: Connection pool settings documented in both Section 5.3 (OrderRepository) and Section 8 (Database Configuration)
   - Current:
     - Section 5.3: "DB_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE: Max connections (default: 20)"
     - Section 8: "Connection pool: 20 connections per instance"
   - Recommendation: Document once in Section 8, reference from Section 5.3:
     - Section 5.3: "Connection pool: See Section 8 (Database Configuration)"
   - Impact: Single source of truth, easier to update
   - Locations: Section 5.3 (line 383), Section 8 (line 625)
```

---

### LOW.5: Document Index Maintenance

**What It Is**:
Document Index line ranges may be outdated or inaccurate after content additions/deletions.

**Best Practice Reference**: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, lines 83-171

**Standard Requirement**:
- Every ARCHITECTURE.md must include Document Index before Section 1
- Index must list all 12 sections with accurate line number ranges
- Update after significant section changes (>10 lines added/removed)

**Example Issue**:
```markdown
5. **Outdated Document Index** (lines 11-23)
   - Observation: Document Index shows "Section 5: Component Details → Lines 351-550" but Section 5 actually starts at line 420
   - Best Practice: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md, lines 83-171 (Document Index standard)
   - Current: Index line ranges haven't been updated in 3 months (30+ lines added to Section 4)
   - Recommendation: Update Document Index line ranges to reflect current content:
     - Verify each section's actual start and end lines
     - Update index entries for all sections affected by recent changes
     - Consider adding "Index Last Updated" timestamp
   - Impact: Improves navigation, enables context-efficient editing, prevents confusion
   - Location: Document Index, lines 11-23
```

---

## Workflow Execution

### Step 1: Trigger

User requests "review", "audit", or "validate" for their ARCHITECTURE.md document.

**Example User Requests**:
- "Please review my ARCHITECTURE.md"
- "Can you audit my architecture document?"
- "Validate my ARCHITECTURE.md for completeness"

---

### Step 2: Phase 1 Execution

1. Run all form validation checks (5 categories)
2. Generate Phase 1 report with ✅/❌/⚠️ indicators
3. If ANY ❌ failed checks exist, **STOP** and return Phase 1 report only

**Phase 1 Report Structure**:
```markdown
## Phase 1: Form Validation

### Status: ❌ FAILED (or ✅ PASSED)

### Failed Checks: (if any)
- ❌ Issue description and location

### Warnings: (if any)
- ⚠️ Non-blocking issues

### Action Required: (if failed)
Fix all ❌ Failed Checks before proceeding to Phase 2
```

---

### Step 3: Phase 1 Pass Gate

**Decision Point**:

- **If Phase 1 has ❌ failed checks**: User must fix issues and re-request review
- **If Phase 1 has ✅ PASSED status**: Proceed to Phase 2

---

### Step 4: Phase 2 Execution

1. Analyze content quality across all 12 sections
2. Identify content issues and categorize by criticality:
   - HIGH: Missing implementation details, dishonest trade-offs, missing metrics, incomplete components, integration gaps
   - MEDIUM: Weak justifications, outdated references, inconsistent formatting, missing cross-references, ambiguous terminology
   - LOW: Formatting suggestions, clarity improvements, additional context, redundancy reduction
3. Generate prioritized improvement report

**Phase 2 Report Structure**:
```markdown
## Phase 2: Content Improvement

### HIGH Criticality (Must Fix Before Publication)
[List HIGH issues with: Issue, Impact, Recommendation, Location]

### MEDIUM Criticality (Improves Clarity)
[List MEDIUM issues with: Issue, Impact, Recommendation, Location]

### LOW Criticality (Optional Polish)
[List LOW issues with: Observation, Recommendation, Impact, Location]
```

---

### Step 5: Final Report

Combine Phase 1 and Phase 2 results into single comprehensive report.

**Presentation Order**:
1. Phase 1 results (✅ PASSED or ❌ FAILED)
2. HIGH criticality issues (if Phase 1 passed)
3. MEDIUM criticality issues (if Phase 1 passed)
4. LOW criticality issues (if Phase 1 passed)

All structural validation checks passed. Proceeding to Phase 2: Content Improvement.

### Warnings:
- ⚠️ Document Index line ranges may be outdated (last update: 90 days ago)
- ⚠️ Section 3.2 (High Availability) trade-off includes vague statement "More complexity"

---

## Phase 2: Content Improvement

### HIGH Criticality (Must Fix Before Publication)

**Found 3 HIGH criticality issues that block publication:**

1. **Missing Implementation Details - OrderService** (Section 5.2)
   - Issue: No failure mode analysis provided
   - Impact: Engineers cannot design error handling, retry logic, or monitoring alerts
   - Recommendation: Add failure modes for:
     - InventoryService unavailable (circuit breaker behavior, fallback)
     - PaymentService timeout (retry strategy, compensation logic)
     - Database connection failure (connection pool exhaustion handling)
   - Location: Section 5.2, lines 293-341

2. **Dishonest Trade-off - High Availability Principle** (Section 3.2)
   - Issue: Trade-off states "More complexity" without specifics
   - Current: "Increased operational complexity managing multiple instances"
   - Impact: Cannot assess true operational burden, staffing requirements, or cost implications
   - Recommendation: Quantify specific costs:
     - "Requires 24/7 on-call rotation (2 engineers minimum)"
     - "3x infrastructure costs: $15K/month vs $5K/month"
     - "10-minute manual database failover RTO"
   - Location: Section 3.2, lines 110-115

3. **Incomplete Component Documentation - PaymentService** (Section 5.4)
   - Issue: No error handling, retry logic, or circuit breaker documentation
   - Impact: Engineers cannot implement resilient payment processing
   - Recommendation: Add:
     - Error handling for Stripe API errors (card declined, timeout, etc.)
     - Retry logic: 3 retries with exponential backoff, idempotency keys
     - Circuit breaker: Open after 50% error rate, 30s timeout
   - Location: Section 5.4, lines 380-420

---

### MEDIUM Criticality (Improves Clarity)

**Found 2 MEDIUM criticality issues that reduce clarity:**

1. **Weak Justification - ADR-001** (Section 12)
   - Issue: Microservices alternative rejected but rationale incomplete
   - Current: "Rejected due to team size and operational complexity"
   - Impact: Future readers may question decision without full context
   - Recommendation: Add specific constraints:
     - "Team of 3 developers (no DevOps engineer)"
     - "Infrastructure budget: <$10K/month"
     - "6-month delay for microservices vs 2-month 3-tier implementation"
   - Location: Section 12, ADR-001, lines 458-461

2. **Missing Cross-Reference - OrderService** (Section 5.2)
   - Issue: References PaymentService without cross-reference link
   - Impact: Readers must manually search for PaymentService documentation
   - Recommendation: Change "via PaymentService" to "via PaymentService (Section 5.4)"
   - Location: Section 5.2, line 305

---

### LOW Criticality (Optional Polish)

**Found 1 LOW criticality enhancement:**

1. **Formatting Suggestion - Section Headers**
   - Observation: Inconsistent blank lines before H2 headers
   - Recommendation: Standardize to 2 blank lines before all H2 headers
   - Impact: Improves visual consistency
   - Location: Throughout document

---

## Summary

- **Phase 1**: ✅ PASSED (all structural checks passed)
- **HIGH issues**: 3 (must fix before publication)
- **MEDIUM issues**: 2 (should fix to improve clarity)
- **LOW issues**: 1 (optional polish)

**Next Steps**:
1. Address 3 HIGH criticality issues (required)
2. Consider addressing 2 MEDIUM issues (recommended)
3. Optionally address LOW issue for polish

**Re-review**: Request new review/audit after addressing HIGH issues
```

## Integration Points

### VALIDATIONS.md Integration

**Relationship**: Phase 1 references existing validation rules from VALIDATIONS.md

**Purpose**:
- VALIDATIONS.md is the **rule repository** (defines what to validate)
- REVIEW_AUDIT_WORKFLOW.md is the **orchestrator** (defines when and how to validate)

**No Duplication**: This workflow document does not duplicate validation logic, only references it

---

### SKILL.md Integration

**Relationship**: SKILL.md triggers this workflow when user requests review/audit

**Integration Point**: When user says "review", "audit", or "validate", SKILL.md follows this workflow

**Update Required**: SKILL.md should reference REVIEW_AUDIT_WORKFLOW.md and replace informal checklist (lines 1598-1610) with reference to this workflow

---

### ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md Integration

**Relationship**: Phase 2 content improvement suggestions **explicitly reference** quality standards from ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md

**Purpose**:
- ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md defines **content quality standards** (what makes good content)
- REVIEW_AUDIT_WORKFLOW.md provides **prioritization framework** (categorizes issues by criticality) and **explicit standard references**

**How Phase 2 References Standards**:
- Each HIGH/MEDIUM issue includes **"Standard Violated"** field with specific guide section and line numbers
- Recommendations quote **"Standard Requirement"** directly from guide
- Examples point to **"Guide Example"** showing proper implementation (with line numbers)
- Compliance checklists help users verify fixes match template requirements

**No Duplication**: This workflow does not duplicate content guidance, only references it with explicit citations to ensure all proposed changes are grounded in documented standards

---

### DESIGN_DRIVER_CALCULATIONS.md Integration

**Relationship**: Leverages existing three-level threshold model (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) for consistency

**Purpose**: Align criticality definitions with design driver impact levels for consistency across architecture-docs skill

---

## Maintenance Notes

### When to Update This File

**Update REVIEW_AUDIT_WORKFLOW.md when**:
- Adding new criticality level (e.g., CRITICAL above HIGH)
- Changing blocking behavior between phases
- Adding new phase (e.g., Phase 3)
- Changing workflow execution steps

### When NOT to Update This File

**Do NOT update this file when**:
- Adding new validation rules → Update **VALIDATIONS.md** instead
