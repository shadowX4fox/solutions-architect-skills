**CRITICAL - Compliance Score Calculation**:
When calculating the Compliance Score in validation_results, N/A items MUST be included in the numerator:
- Compliance Score = (PASS items + N/A items + EXCEPTION items) / (Total items) × 10
- N/A items count as fully compliant (10 points each)
- Example: 6 PASS, 5 N/A, 0 FAIL, 0 UNKNOWN → (6+5)/11 × 10 = 10.0/10 (100%)
- Add note in contract output: "Note: N/A items counted as fully compliant (included in compliance score)"
