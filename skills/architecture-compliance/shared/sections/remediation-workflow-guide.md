## How to Remediate Gaps Using Architecture-Docs Skill

The `architecture-docs` skill provides an efficient, guided workflow to remediate gaps identified in compliance contracts. This section provides step-by-step instructions for using the skill to achieve AUTO_APPROVE status (8.0+ validation score).

---

### Quick Start (For Simple Gaps)

Use this workflow when you have 1-3 simple gaps to fix:

1. **Activate the architecture-docs skill**:
   ```
   /skill architecture-docs
   ```

2. **Specify what you need**: "Add [missing item] to Section [X]"
   - Example: "Add cost monitoring configuration to Section 11"
   - Example: "Add OAuth 2.0 authentication to Section 9"

3. **Review and confirm**: The skill will update the specified section with proper formatting and structure

4. **Regenerate contract**: Run compliance generation to verify the gap is resolved

**When to use**: You have fewer than 3 gaps, all in known sections, with clear remediation actions.

---

### Standard Workflow (Most Common)

Use this workflow for typical compliance remediation with 3-10 gaps:

1. **Review compliance contract** to identify all UNKNOWN and FAIL items
   - Check Section A.3.1 "Common Gaps Quick Reference" table
   - Note the ARCHITECTURE.md section numbers for each gap
   - Identify impact levels (BLOCKER, High, Medium)

2. **Prioritize by impact**: Work on highest-impact gaps first
   - **BLOCKER** (0.5-0.8 pts): Critical compliance failures
   - **High** (0.3-0.5 pts): Major missing documentation
   - **Medium** (0.1-0.2 pts): Optional or minor improvements

3. **Activate skill**:
   ```
   /skill architecture-docs
   ```

4. **Work section-by-section**: Address gaps one section at a time
   - Request: "Review Section [X] for completeness. Gaps: [list gaps from compliance contract]"
   - Example: "Review Section 9 for completeness. Gaps: missing mTLS config, no API authentication documented, certificate management not specified"

5. **Let skill guide you**: Follow the two-phase validation workflow
   - **Phase 1**: Structure validation (sections present, proper formatting)
   - **Phase 2**: Content improvements (completeness, quality, traceability)

6. **Regenerate contract** to verify score improvement
   - Run compliance generation again
   - Check that UNKNOWN/FAIL items are now PASS
   - Verify validation score increased

**When to use**: Most compliance remediation scenarios with multiple gaps across different sections.

---

### Advanced Workflow (Multiple Gaps or Full Review)

Use this workflow when you have 10+ gaps or want comprehensive validation:

1. **Request full compliance review**:
   ```
   /skill architecture-docs
   ```
   Then ask: "Review ARCHITECTURE.md for [Contract Type] compliance"
   - Example: "Review ARCHITECTURE.md for Cloud Architecture compliance"
   - Example: "Review ARCHITECTURE.md for Security Architecture compliance"

2. **Use two-phase validation workflow**: Let the skill systematically validate structure and content
   - **Phase 1** (Structure): Ensures all required sections exist with proper formatting
   - **Phase 2** (Content): Validates completeness, quality, and compliance requirements

3. **Iterate through violations**: Address each category systematically
   - Start with BLOCKER violations (critical compliance failures)
   - Move to UNKNOWN items (missing data)
   - Address FAIL items (non-compliant technologies)
   - Finally improve quality (source traceability)

4. **Verify after each major change**:
   - Request section-specific validation: "Validate Section [X] completeness"
   - Check metric consistency: "Verify metrics in Section [X] match Section 1 design drivers"

5. **Final verification**: Regenerate compliance contract and compare scores

**When to use**: Comprehensive architecture review, major compliance gaps (10+ items), or preparing for formal approval.

### Skill Capabilities

The `architecture-docs` skill can help with:

- ✅ **Add missing sections**: Uses standard ARCHITECTURE.md templates for each section
- ✅ **Calculate design drivers**: Derives quantitative metrics from Business Context (Section 1)
- ✅ **Validate architecture principles**: Ensures all 9 principles documented with trade-offs (Section 3)
- ✅ **Check metric consistency**: Validates that performance/scalability/availability targets align across sections
- ✅ **Generate ADRs**: Creates Architecture Decision Records for technology choices (Section 12)
- ✅ **Add source traceability**: Includes section and line number references for compliance audit trails
- ✅ **Load sections incrementally**: Context-efficient approach that loads only needed sections
- ✅ **Domain-specific guidance**: Understands Cloud, Security, SRE, Integration, and other architecture domains

### Common Commands

| Task | Command Example |
|------|-----------------|
| **Add missing section** | "Add Section [X] using standard template" |
| **Review section completeness** | "Review Section [X] for completeness" |
| **Fix metric consistency** | "Ensure metrics in Section [X] match Section 1 values" |
| **Add architecture principle** | "Add [Principle Name] to Section 3 with trade-offs" |
| **Create ADR** | "Create ADR for [decision] in Section 12" |
| **Add security control** | "Add [control] to Section 9 → [subsection]" |
| **Add cloud configuration** | "Add [config] to Section 4 with [provider]-specific details" |
| **Add monitoring setup** | "Add [monitoring tool/config] to Section 11" |
| **Full validation** | "Validate ARCHITECTURE.md against [domain] architecture standards" |

---

### Remediation Tips

1. **Start with structure, then content**: Ensure all required sections exist before filling in details

2. **Be specific in requests**:
   - ❌ Vague: "Add encryption"
   - ✅ Specific: "Add TLS 1.3 encryption to Section 9 → Network Security with cipher suite recommendations"

3. **Provide context**:
   - ❌ Generic: "Add monitoring"
   - ✅ Contextual: "Add Azure Monitor configuration to Section 11 with Application Insights and Log Analytics workspace"

4. **Iterate section-by-section**: Don't try to fix everything at once
   - Fix Section 9 (Security) completely
   - Regenerate contract to verify
   - Move to Section 11 (Observability)
   - Regenerate again

5. **Verify after each change**: Run compliance generation frequently to ensure progress
   - Check validation score improvement
   - Verify UNKNOWN → PASS conversions
   - Ensure no new issues introduced

6. **Use domain-specific language**: Reference the architecture domain in your requests
   - "Add AWS Well-Architected Framework mapping" (Cloud Architecture)
   - "Add SLO definitions with error budgets" (SRE Architecture)
   - "Add OAuth 2.0 flows" (Security Architecture)
   - "Add API catalog" (Integration Architecture)

7. **Reference the gap table**: Use exact gap descriptions from Section A.3.1
   - Copy the "Gap Description" from compliance contract
   - Include the section number from "ARCHITECTURE.md Section" column
   - Follow the "Recommended Action" guidance

8. **Check source traceability**: Ensure all added content includes section and line references
   - Quality score depends on source traceability coverage
   - Ask skill to "ensure all items have source references"

### Example Interaction

**Scenario**: Cloud Architecture contract shows score 6.8/10 with 5 UNKNOWN items

**Step 1: Activate skill**
```
/skill architecture-docs
```

**Step 2: Request section review**
```
Review Section 11 for completeness. Gaps from compliance contract:
- Missing cost monitoring configuration
- No resource tagging strategy documented
- Rightsizing review schedule not defined
```

**Step 3: Follow skill guidance**
- Skill validates Section 11 structure
- Skill identifies missing subsections
- Skill suggests specific additions with examples

**Step 4: Confirm additions**
```
Yes, add those subsections with the recommended content
```

**Step 5: Verify**
- Regenerate compliance contract
- Check validation score (should increase to 7.5-8.0+)
- Verify UNKNOWN items now show PASS

---

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Skill says section already exists but compliance contract shows gap**
- **A**: Section may exist but lack required details. Ask: "Review Section [X] for [specific gap] completeness"

**Q: Added content but score didn't improve**
- **A**: Check source traceability. Ask: "Add source references (section and line numbers) to all items in Section [X]"

**Q: Multiple FAIL items for deprecated technologies**
- **A**: Create ADR for exception or upgrade path: "Create ADR in Section 12 for [technology] with migration plan"

**Q: Score improved but still below 8.0**
- **A**: Review Section A.3.3 "Achieving Auto-Approve Status" for prioritized next steps

**Q: Compliance contract regeneration shows same score**
- **A**: Verify ARCHITECTURE.md was actually updated (check file modification timestamp). Re-run skill commands if needed.

---

### Next Steps After Remediation

1. **Regenerate all relevant compliance contracts**: Changes to ARCHITECTURE.md may affect multiple contract types

2. **Review validation scores**: Aim for 8.0+ for automatic approval

3. **Submit for review**: Contracts with scores 7.0-7.9 require manual review by approval authority

4. **Track over time**: Keep ARCHITECTURE.md updated as architecture evolves to maintain compliance
