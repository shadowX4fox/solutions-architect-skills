## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Document Owner | [SOLUTION_ARCHITECT or N/A] |
| Last Review Date | [GENERATION_DATE] |
| Next Review Date | [NEXT_REVIEW_DATE] |
| Status | [DOCUMENT_STATUS] |
| Validation Score | [VALIDATION_SCORE]/10 |
| Validation Status | [VALIDATION_STATUS] |
| Validation Date | [VALIDATION_DATE] |
| Validation Evaluator | [VALIDATION_EVALUATOR] |
| Review Actor | [REVIEW_ACTOR] |
| Approval Authority | [APPROVAL_AUTHORITY] |

**Validation Configuration**: `/skills/architecture-compliance/validation/business_continuity_validation.json`

**Dynamic Field Instructions for Document Generation**:

- `[DOCUMENT_STATUS]`: Determined by validation_results.outcome.document_status
  - Score 8.0-10.0 → "Approved" (auto-approved)
  - Score 7.0-7.9 → "In Review" (ready for manual review)
  - Score 5.0-6.9 → "Draft" (needs work)
  - Score 0.0-4.9 → "Rejected" (blocked)

- `[VALIDATION_SCORE]`: From validation_results.final_score (format: "8.7/10")

- `[VALIDATION_STATUS]`: From validation_results.outcome.overall_status
  - "PASS" (score ≥ 7.0)
  - "CONDITIONAL" (score 5.0-6.9)
  - "FAIL" (score < 5.0)

- `[VALIDATION_DATE]`: From validation_results.validation_date → "YYYY-MM-DD" or "Not performed"

- `[VALIDATION_EVALUATOR]`: "Claude Code (Automated Validation Engine)"

- `[REVIEW_ACTOR]`: From validation_results.outcome.review_actor
  - Score 8.0-10.0 → "System (Auto-Approved)"
  - Score 7.0-7.9 → "Business Continuity Review Board"
  - Score 5.0-6.9 → "Architecture Team"
  - Score 0.0-4.9 → "N/A (Blocked)"

- `[APPROVAL_AUTHORITY]`: "Business Continuity Review Board"

**Validation Requirements**:
- Validation score ≥ 7.0 MANDATORY for approval pathway
- Score 8.0-10.0: Automatic approval (no human review required)
- Score 7.0-7.9: Manual review by Business Continuity Review Board required
- Score 5.0-6.9: Must address gaps before proceeding to review
- Score < 5.0: Contract rejected, cannot proceed

**CRITICAL - Compliance Score Calculation**:
When calculating the Compliance Score in validation_results, N/A items MUST be included in the numerator:
- Compliance Score = (PASS items + N/A items + EXCEPTION items) / (Total items) × 10
- N/A items count as fully compliant (10 points each)
- Example: 6 PASS, 5 N/A, 0 FAIL, 0 UNKNOWN → (6+5)/11 × 10 = 10.0/10 (100%)
- Add note in contract output: "Note: N/A items counted as fully compliant (included in compliance score)"

## Appendix: Source Traceability and Completion Status

### A.1 Definitions and Terminology

**Business Continuity Terms**:
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: Maximum acceptable downtime before business impact becomes unacceptable
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time
- **DR (Disaster Recovery)**: Process and procedures for recovering IT systems after a disaster
- **Failover**: Automatic switching to redundant system when primary system fails
- **Backup**: Copy of data stored separately for recovery purposes
- **High Availability (HA)**: System design ensuring minimal downtime through redundancy
- **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**: Documented procedures for maintaining business operations during disruptions
- **Hot Site**: Fully operational backup facility ready for immediate failover
- **Cold Site**: Backup location with basic infrastructure requiring configuration before use
- **Warm Site**: Partially configured backup facility requiring some setup time

**Status Codes**:
- **Compliant**: Requirement fully satisfied with documented evidence
- **Non-Compliant**: Requirement not met or missing from ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Not Applicable**: Requirement does not apply to this solution
- **Unknown**: Partial information exists but insufficient to determine compliance

**Compliance Abbreviations**:
- **LABC**: Business Continuity compliance requirement code
- **MTTR**: Mean Time To Recovery
- **MTBF**: Mean Time Between Failures
- **SLA**: Service Level Agreement

### A.2 Validation Methodology

**Validation Process**:

1. **Completeness Check (40% weight)**:
   - Counts filled data points across all LABC requirements
   - Formula: (Filled fields / Total required fields) × 10
   - Example: 8 out of 10 fields = 8.0/10 completeness

2. **Compliance Check (50% weight)**:
   - Evaluates each validation item as PASS/FAIL/N/A/UNKNOWN
   - Formula: (PASS + N/A + EXCEPTION items) / Total items × 10
   - **CRITICAL**: N/A items MUST be included in numerator
   - Example: 6 PASS + 2 N/A + 0 EXCEPTION out of 10 items = (6+2)/10 × 10 = 8.0/10

3. **Quality Check (10% weight)**:
   - Assesses source traceability (ARCHITECTURE.md section references)
   - Verifies explanation quality and actionable notes
   - Formula: (Items with valid sources / Total items) × 10

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   ```
   Final Score = (Completeness × 0.4) + (Compliance × 0.5) + (Quality × 0.1)
   ```

**Outcome Determination**:
| Score Range | Document Status | Review Actor | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| 8.0-10.0 | Approved | System (Auto-Approved) | Ready for implementation |
| 7.0-7.9 | In Review | Business Continuity Review Board | Manual review required |
| 5.0-6.9 | Draft | Architecture Team | Address gaps before review |
| 0.0-4.9 | Rejected | N/A (Blocked) | Cannot proceed - critical continuity gaps |

### A.3 Document Completion Guide

**For Architecture Teams**:

If this contract shows "Non-Compliant" or "Unknown" items:

1. **Identify Missing Sections**: Review the "Note" field for each item
2. **Locate ARCHITECTURE.md Section**: The note specifies target section (10 or 11)
3. **Add Required Content**: Document the missing business continuity information in the specified section
4. **Regenerate Contract**: Run compliance generation again after updates

**Common Business Continuity Gaps and Remediation**:

| Missing Item | ARCHITECTURE.md Section | What to Add |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| RTO/RPO values | Section 11.3 (Backup & Disaster Recovery) | Define recovery objectives (e.g., RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 1 hour) |
| Backup strategy | Section 11.3 (Backup & Disaster Recovery) | Document backup frequency, retention, and storage location |
| DR testing plan | Section 11.4 (Disaster Recovery) | Define DR drill schedule and validation procedures |
| Failover mechanisms | Section 11.2 (High Availability) | Specify automatic failover configuration and triggers |
| Data replication | Section 11.3 or 11.4 | Document geo-replication strategy and RPO alignment |
