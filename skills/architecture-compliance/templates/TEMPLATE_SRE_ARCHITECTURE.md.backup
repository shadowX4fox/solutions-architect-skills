|-------|-------|
| Document Owner | [SOLUTION_ARCHITECT or N/A] |
| Last Review Date | [GENERATION_DATE] |
| Next Review Date | [NEXT_REVIEW_DATE] |
| Status | [DOCUMENT_STATUS] |
| Validation Score | [VALIDATION_SCORE]/10 |

**Validation Configuration**: `/skills/architecture-compliance/validation/sre_architecture_validation.json`

**Dynamic Field Instructions for Document Generation**:

- `[DOCUMENT_STATUS]`: Determined by validation_results.outcome.document_status
  - Score 8.0-10.0 → "Approved" (auto-approved)
  - Score 7.0-7.9 → "In Review" (ready for manual review)
  - Score 5.0-6.9 → "Draft" (needs work)
  - Score 0.0-4.9 → "Rejected" (blocked)

- `[VALIDATION_SCORE]`: From validation_results.final_score (format: "8.7/10")

- `[VALIDATION_STATUS]`: From validation_results.outcome.overall_status
  - "PASS" (score ≥ 7.0)
  - "CONDITIONAL" (score 5.0-6.9)
  - "FAIL" (score < 5.0)

- `[VALIDATION_DATE]`: From validation_results.validation_date → "YYYY-MM-DD" or "Not performed"

- `[VALIDATION_EVALUATOR]`: "Claude Code (Automated Validation Engine)"

- `[REVIEW_ACTOR]`: From validation_results.outcome.review_actor
  - Score 8.0-10.0 → "System (Auto-Approved)"
  - Score 7.0-7.9 → "SRE Leadership/Operations"
  - Score 5.0-6.9 → "Architecture Team"
  - Score 0.0-4.9 → "N/A (Blocked)"

- `[APPROVAL_AUTHORITY]`: "SRE Leadership/Operations"

**Validation Requirements**:
- Validation score ≥ 7.0 MANDATORY for approval pathway
- Score 8.0-10.0: Automatic approval (no human review required)
- Score 7.0-7.9: Manual review by SRE Leadership/Operations required
- Score 5.0-6.9: Must address gaps before proceeding to review
- Score < 5.0: Contract rejected, cannot proceed

**CRITICAL - Two-Tier Compliance Scoring**:
This template uses a two-tier scoring system for SRE requirements:

**Blocker Requirements (36 total)** - MANDATORY:
- ALL Blocker requirements must be Compliant or Not Applicable for approval
- Status values: Compliant, Non-Compliant, Not Applicable, Unknown
- Non-Compliant or Unknown Blocker requirements BLOCK approval (score capped at 4.9)
- Blocker Score = (Compliant + Not Applicable) / 36 → Must be 100% for approval pathway

**Desired Requirements (21 total)** - OPTIONAL:
- Desired requirements are enhancement recommendations
- Only counted if status is Compliant or Not Applicable
- Non-Compliant or Unknown Desired requirements do NOT block approval
- Desired Score = (Compliant + Not Applicable) / 21 → Enhancement metric

**Final Score Calculation**:
- Final Score = (Blocker Score × 0.7) + (Desired Score × 0.3)
- Minimum for approval (score ≥ 7.0): All 36 Blocker requirements pass
- Auto-approval (score ≥ 8.0): All 36 Blocker pass + at least 60% Desired requirements

**Note**: Not Applicable items counted as fully compliant (included in compliance score)

## Appendix: Source Traceability and Completion Status

### A.1 Definitions and Terminology

**SRE Architecture Terms**:
- **SLO (Service Level Objective)**: Target level of service reliability agreed upon between service provider and users
- **SLI (Service Level Indicator)**: Quantifiable measure of service performance (e.g., latency, availability, error rate)
- **Error Budget**: Maximum allowable downtime or errors before SLO is violated
- **Golden Signals**: Core monitoring metrics (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
- **Observability**: Ability to understand system internal state from external outputs (logs, metrics, traces)
- **MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)**: Average time to restore service after incident
- **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)**: Average time between system failures
- **Toil**: Manual, repetitive operational work that should be automated
- **Incident Management**: Process for responding to service disruptions
- **Blameless Postmortem**: Retrospective analysis focusing on systemic improvements, not individual blame

**Status Codes**:
- **Compliant**: Requirement fully satisfied with documented evidence
- **Non-Compliant**: Requirement not met or missing from ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Not Applicable**: Requirement does not apply to this solution
- **Unknown**: Partial information exists but insufficient to determine compliance

**SRE Abbreviations**:
- **LASRE**: SRE Architecture compliance requirement code
- **RED**: Rate, Errors, Duration (monitoring methodology)
- **USE**: Utilization, Saturation, Errors (resource monitoring)
- **APM**: Application Performance Monitoring
- **RCA**: Root Cause Analysis

---

### A.2 Validation Methodology

**Validation Process**:

1. **Completeness Check (40% weight)**:
   - Counts filled data points across all LASRE requirements
   - Formula: (Filled fields / Total required fields) × 10
   - Example: 32 out of 36 fields = 8.9/10 completeness

2. **Compliance Check (50% weight)**:
   - Evaluates each validation item as PASS/FAIL/N/A/UNKNOWN
   - Formula: (PASS + N/A + EXCEPTION items) / Total items × 10
   - **CRITICAL**: N/A items MUST be included in numerator
   - Example: 28 PASS + 4 N/A + 0 EXCEPTION out of 36 items = (28+4)/36 × 10 = 8.9/10

3. **Quality Check (10% weight)**:
   - Assesses source traceability (ARCHITECTURE.md section references)
   - Verifies explanation quality and actionable notes
   - Formula: (Items with valid sources / Total items) × 10

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   ```
   Final Score = (Completeness × 0.4) + (Compliance × 0.5) + (Quality × 0.1)
   ```

**Outcome Determination**:
| Score Range | Document Status | Review Actor | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| 8.0-10.0 | Approved | System (Auto-Approved) | Ready for implementation |
| 7.0-7.9 | In Review | SRE Review Board | Manual review required |
| 5.0-6.9 | Draft | Architecture Team | Address SRE gaps before review |
| 0.0-4.9 | Rejected | N/A (Blocked) | Cannot proceed - critical SRE practices missing |

---

### A.3 Document Completion Guide

**For Architecture Teams**:

If this contract shows "Non-Compliant" or "Unknown" items:

1. **Identify Missing Sections**: Review the "Note" field for each item
2. **Locate ARCHITECTURE.md Section**: The note specifies target section (2, 4, 5, 7, 10, or 11)
3. **Add Required SRE Content**: Document the missing SRE practices in the specified section
4. **Regenerate Contract**: Run compliance generation again after updates

**Common SRE Gaps and Remediation**:

| Missing Item | ARCHITECTURE.md Section | What to Add |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| SLO definitions | Section 10 (Performance Requirements) | Define SLOs with targets (e.g., 99.9% availability, p99 latency < 200ms) |
| Error budget policy | Section 10 (Performance) | Document error budget calculation and consumption policies |
| Observability stack | Section 11 (Operational Considerations) | Specify monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, etc.) |
| Incident response plan | Section 11 (Operational → Incident Management) | Define on-call rotation, escalation paths, runbooks |
| Deployment automation | Section 11 (Operational → Deployment) | Document CI/CD pipeline, rollback procedures, canary releases |
| Load testing strategy | Section 10 (Performance) | Specify load test scenarios, tools, and acceptance criteria |
