# Compliance Contract Types - Reference

## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive description of the 11 compliance contract types available in the architecture-compliance skill. It serves as a reference for creating, validating, and selecting contract templates.

---

## Contract Type Validation

When generating compliance contracts, the architecture-compliance skill validates user-requested contract types against this reference list. If an unrecognized contract type is requested, the skill offers the 3 best alternative matches based on:
- **Keyword matching**: Identifying common words between user input and contract names/keywords
- **Alias recognition**: Matching against known aliases for contract types (e.g., "sre" → "SRE Architecture")
- **Fuzzy string matching**: Calculating edit distance for typo tolerance (e.g., "securtiy" → "security")

**Supported contract types** (11 total):
1. Business Continuity
2. SRE Architecture
3. Cloud Architecture
4. Data & AI Architecture
5. Development Architecture
6. Process Transformation and Automation
7. Security Architecture
8. IT Infrastructure
9. Enterprise Architecture
10. Integration Architecture
11. Risk Management

**Aliases and shortcuts**: See SKILL.md Phase 2.1 for complete Contract Type Aliases and Keywords table.

**Validation behavior**:
- **Exact match**: Contract generated immediately
- **Alias match**: Alias resolved to full contract type name, contract generated
- **No match**: User presented with 3 best alternatives to choose from
- **Ambiguous input**: User can select "Other" to see all 11 contract types with descriptions

For detailed validation scenarios, see SKILL.md "Phase 2.1 Example Scenarios" section.

## Source Traceability Policy

All compliance contracts generated by this skill follow a **strict source traceability policy** to ensure audit compliance.

**Policy Summary:**
- Every data point must reference an actual ARCHITECTURE.md section and line number
- No inference, derivation, or guessing of values is permitted
- Missing data is clearly marked with `[PLACEHOLDER]` and section guidance

**Extraction Methods:**
1. **Direct Extraction**: Value explicitly stated in ARCHITECTURE.md
2. **Aggregation**: Multiple values consolidated from different sections
3. **Transformation**: Calculated values with formula shown and source reference

**Prohibited Actions:**
- Inferring values from context (e.g., inferring "Tier 1" from 99.99% SLA)
- Deriving values from architectural patterns
- Guessing section locations or creating non-existent sections
- Suggesting specific values without ARCHITECTURE.md source

**Placeholder Format:**
When data is missing, placeholders include:
- Section reference where data should be added
- Optional industry standard reference (informational only)
- Specific guidance on subsection path

**Example:**
```
**Authentication Method**: [PLACEHOLDER: Not specified in ARCHITECTURE.md Section 9.1]
Optional Reference: Common patterns: OAuth 2.0 + JWT (IETF RFC 6749), SAML 2.0
Note: Add authentication approach to ARCHITECTURE.md Section 9.1 (Security Architecture → Authentication)
```

This policy ensures compliance documents are fully auditable for regulatory requirements.
